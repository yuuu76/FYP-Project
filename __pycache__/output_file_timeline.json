To see a glimpse of what could be in the future it's worth looking to the past, and what Americans were watching in the 1980s, during the years immediately preceding the Berlin Wall coming down and the Soviet Union crumbling.There was no one kind of Cold War movie during that period, but a variety that tugged at different threads. The plots ranged from traditional spy fare and stock, go-to villains to Soviet invasions of the US to hopeful demonstrations of Russians and Americans finding common ground, even if their countries didn't. Others focused on the threat of nuclear annihilation, a concern exemplified by earlier movies like \"Failsafe\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\" but brought to vivid life -- and directly into living rooms -- in the '80s.That last bracket included \"The Day After,\" a 1983 TV movie considered so provocative that the Reagan administration appealed to ABC not to broadcast it. Shown with limited commercial interruption because of the content, the movie drew a massive audience -- a cultural moment captured, fittingly, in the FX series \"The Americans,\" which dealt with Soviet spies operating within the US. \"Testament,\" released the same year, offered a lower-key but no less devastating view of nuclear war's aftermath, while \"War Games\" provided a more Hollywood-friendly spin.Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell and Charlie Sheen in the 1984 film 'Red Dawn.'That period also included \"Red Dawn,\" in which teenagers defend the US homeland from invading forces; and \"Amerika,\" an ABC miniseries that imagined a future America under Soviet-occupied control.Read MoreDespite Cold War apprehensions, there were plenty of broadly entertaining films built against that backdrop. \"Rocky IV\" actually sees the title character win over the Russian crowd against towering Soviet champion Ivan Drago, while another Sylvester Stallone franchise, \"Rambo III,\" had the trained killing machine team up with brave Afghans against the Soviets. With its spies-among-us hook, \"No Way Out\" was in a way an early version of \"The Americans,\" while Chevy Chase and Dan Akyroyd co-starred in the 1985 comedy \"Spies Like Us.\"Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase in the 1985 film 'Spies Like Us'As for the notion of cross-national partnerships, examples range from \"Red Heat,\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, to \"Gorky Park,\" with William Hurt as a Russian detective seeking to solve a trio of murders while navigating a cesspool of corruption, and for a time partnering with an American cop.As Emma Piper-Burket wrote in a 2017 article for Rogerebert.com, while many '80s films incorporated Russians and Americans cooperating despite the political climate, \"After the dissolution of the USSR, however, Hollywood quickly resumed perpetuating its familiar trope of Russian bad guys.\"More recent series like \"The Americans\" and \"Homeland\" have offered a more nuanced view of Russian characters. During their heday, retired Gen. Michael Hayden (who had consulted on the latter) told the Washington Post that in the past, \"There was a theoretical certainty \u2014  Marxism bad, totalitarianism bad. The Russians didn't need much explaining.\"Keri Russell and  Matthew Rhys played Russian spys in 'The Americans.'The question is where the Russian image goes from here. Michael Kackman, an associate professor of television at Notre Dame whose specialties include Cold War American culture, expressed hope that the stories of individual Russians wouldn't be lost in the rush toward broad-strokes portrayals.\"Part of the tricky thing is in American popular culture Russians are imaginary people, or at least were during most of the Cold War,\" Kackman told CNN. If the goal is greater understanding, he added, it's important to remember \"that Russia isn't just Putin, and to try to be reasonably empathetic\" about people living within that system.One of the more memorable demonstrations of that mindset in the 1980s came not from film or TV, but Sting's song \"Russians,\" which capsulized a vision of the path to peace with the lyric, \"I hope the Russians love their children too.\" The musician recently issued a new version of the song as \"a plea for our common humanity. For the brave Ukrainians fighting against this brutal tyranny and also the many Russians who are protesting this outrage despite the threat of arrest and imprisonment.\"Because it can take years for an idea to become a movie or TV show, it's difficult to say now where recent events will lead. But if the '80s are any indication -- and the content landscape has grown exponentially in the decades since --  it won't fit in just one basket.The world is complicated, and we are too,\" Kackman said. \"All of those representations are in circulation together.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "19"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "In \"Life & Beth,\" Amy Schumer plays a woman who looks to live her best life.

As is, this meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)If there were awards for most-annoying characters, \"WeCrashed\" would have a mantle full of them. As is, this meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun.Add Leto's Adam Neumann to the list of fast-talking hustlers who built vast empires, only to see them come, well, crashing down. In this case, the house of cards is WeWork, which went from a single coworking space to a global operation worth billions before its inevitable downfall.Neumann bills himself as a \"serial entrepreneur,\" a fancy way of saying he's determined to get rich and keep throwing out ideas until one strikes gold. The problem, as the eight-episode Apple TV+ series illustrates in exhaustive detail, is that his commitment to sell, sell, sell obscures a hollow shell, covered up by the wild parties he throws and cult-like devotion he seeks to engender.Beginning in 2019, \"WeCrashed\" flashes back a dozen years to chart Neumann's rise, along with his courtship and marriage to Rebekah (Hathaway), who's his match in terms of the evangelical zeal that she brings to the enterprise. Indeed, as depicted she coins the idea that WeWork is \"not a business. It's a feeling,\" talking with laughable earnestness about \"the soul of the company.\"Still, there's a tired, repetitive quality to the way the episodes unfold, with Neumann spouting mantras like \"Built to grow\" and buying market share while the company hemorrhages money. The trick is staying one step ahead of his board, finding new deep-pocketed investors that he can beguile, never mind what the balance sheet says.Read MoreLeto disappears into the role, from Neumann's Israeli accent to walking around barefoot, able to go from charming people to warning a competitor \"I am going to crush you\" with a smile on his face.Hathaway similarly lowers her voice while turning up the intensity as Rebekah, who, faced with a dispute over her children's school, simply decides to start her own. When a friend asks, \"Is Adam for real?,\" her assurance that he is, based on the available evidence, feels like equal parts complicity and delusion.Still, those performances play almost like a parody of start-up wealth run amok, coming in the service of a so-so series. That's certainly true compared to Hulu's \"The Dropout,\" about Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos; and \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,\" other cautionary tales about corporate greed gone wrong. (The story was also the subject of a 2021 documentary, \"WeWork: or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn.\")Adapted from the Wondery podcast, \"WeCrashed\" ultimately shares something in common with its subject matter in one key respect: Despite a pair of Oscar winners front and center in Leto and Hathaway, it looks better on paper then it does once you start wading through the fine print.\"WeCrashed\" premieres March 18 on Apple TV+.

While the movie falls apart toward the end, the mystery -- and crackling central performances -- cruises along at a low boil much of the way.Adapted from the novel by Patricia Highsmith (\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\") and relegated to a low-key premiere on Hulu, the story hinges on the strange marriage between Vic (Affleck) and Melinda (\"Knives Out's\" de Armas), a picture-perfect couple that outwardly have everything, including his invention-earned wealth and their adorable young daughter.The two have reached an apparent understanding, however, that allows her to compensate for his indifference and emotional distance by taking lovers, an unhappily-ever-after dynamic that causes discomfort among their friends, with whom they regularly throw neighborhood parties, mostly due to her brazenness.As for Vic, he acts unperturbed by his wife's infidelity, but there's the little matter of Melinda's one-time \"friend\" who has gone missing, and lingering suspicions as to whether he had anything to do with that.Vic doesn't seek to quell those rumblings, underscoring the mind games that the couple plays not only with each other, but those around them. When a pulp writer (Tracy Letts) who is new to the community observes that Vic's \"a weird guy,\" Vic merely smiles at his wife having said much the same to him and responds, \"So I've been told.\"Read MoreKnown for his glossy excess, Lyne practically invented this modern variant of the erotic thriller with \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Indecent Proposal\" and later \"Unfaithful,\" the film that this movie most closely resembles in tone and topic. The irony, of course, is that while some will watch out of curiosity about the leads due to their off-screen relationship, most of de Armas' steamiest scenes happen with others.Lyne and screenwriters Zach Helm and \"Euphoria's\" Sam Levinson have taken liberties with the novel, but the broad outlines make for a tense, twisty atmosphere -- at least, until they pull back the curtain, sacrificing the psychological uncertainty and squandering that momentum down the stretch.It's nevertheless a strong showcase for Affleck -- whose history with the genre includes \"Gone Girl\" -- and de Armas, playing a character seemingly determined to test how far she can push her aloof husband, desperate to elicit some sort of emotional reaction.Despite the tabloid-tinted side of the star pairing, this once-thriving formula is no longer enough to lift the film's must-see factor out of the shallow end commercially speaking, which likely explains its debut via streaming, not theaters.Still, Affleck and de Armas' generate enough heat to make \"Deep Water\" worth watching, even if the movie seems destined to generate its biggest splash over what transpired off screen instead of what's on it. \"Deep Water\" premieres March 18 on Hulu.

But \"DMZ\" merely uses that backdrop as a device to introduce another dystopian drama based on a DC graphic novel, basically \"The Walking Dead\" meets the '70s artifact \"The Warriors.\" The result is an uninvolving miniseries that, at four parts, feels either too long or not nearly long enough.That's because the war has already happened when the story begins, finding the US divided, with Manhattan turned into a lawless \"demilitarized zone\" between the two riven sides. Years after being separated from her teenage son as they fled the chaos, Alma (Rosario Dawson) braves returning to that zone, determined to be reunited with him no matter what the cost.What Alma finds, though, is a population essentially divided into wary factions, working toward a vote seeking to provide greater order and unity to their society. On one end sits Alma's ex, Parco (Benjamin Bratt), and on the other Wilson (Hoon Lee), each ruthless and brutal in their own way.Adapted by Roberto Patino (\"Westworld\"), with a premiere directed by Ava DuVernay and the remaining episodes helmed by Ernest Dickerson, there's ample talent both behind and in front of the camera.The net effect, however, is dramatically inert, perhaps in part because there have been so many variations on this theme, and because Alma's quest -- and the idea of a mother desperate to reconnect with her now-grown child -- overshadows the more interesting or distinctive aspects, turning it into a rather generic action thriller.Read MoreNor does it help that the narrative basically joins the story in progress, without pausing or flashing back -- as, say, \"The Handmaid's Tale\" did -- to flesh out how America reached this sorry point.Despite her resourcefulness and history with the key players, Alma too often feels like a bystander as conflicts rage around her, through no fault of Dawson's, who is pulling double streaming duty as Ahsoka Tano.

Yet an equally sobering aspect of this two-part HBO documentary involves Wood's upbringing in Hollywood, and her memories of being sexualized in movies at an early age.The headline-grabbing foundation involves Wood's fight for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in conjunction with a coalition of other survivors, which successfully lobbied to extend the statute of limitations on such cases in California.At length, Wood describes meeting Manson, a.k.a. Brian Warner, when she was 18 (he was 37), the beginnings of their romance and disturbing allegations about how she was abused, including a music video in which their interactions prompted concern among members of the crew. Manson declined an interview, but his legal counsel provided a detailed statement to the filmmakers saying that he \"vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone,\" and that former partners had \"weaponized\" consensual relationships into \"fabricated horror stories.\"Directed by Amy Berg (\"The Case against Adnan Syed\"), much of the documentary is devoted to Wood finding her voice to speak out, acknowledging her apprehensions about doing so. She was \"terrified\" to name Manson publicly, she says, adding that doing so risks \"retraumatizing yourself\" and \"putting a target on your back.\" In the second half, she meets with other alleged survivors of purported abuse by Manson, a segment that drags on a bit too long.\"Phoenix Rising\" proves most compelling during the first part, which includes a step-by-step breakdown of common patterns that domestic abusers follow to control and intimidate victims. That chapter incorporates Wood's family issues and history, moving to Hollywood after her parents separated and becoming a child star, appearing in the extremely edgy \"Thirteen,\" a stark independent film about troubled teens. Read MoreWood, who was 14 while shooting the movie, discusses her discomfort with certain scenes, including one in which she had to make out with a 23-year-old actor.

That's a fitting metaphor for the character's much-debated history in movies, which has cast an unusually large shadow thanks to fans convinced, in their minds, precisely how the Dark Knight should be depicted.Created in 1939, Batman isn't the first superhero or even necessarily the best. But different approaches to adapting him for the screen have provoked inordinate passion among fans, including knee-jerk reactions that border on the hysterical. That included the howls that greeted casting Michael Keaton in the 1980s (admittedly an unorthodox choice) and perhaps especially Ben Affleck in 2013.In a December interview with Howard Stern, Affleck admitted feeling \"hurt\" by an online petition that circulated opposing him starring in \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\" For his part, Stern pointed out that Batman aficionados have a track record of complaining \"no matter who gets that role.\"Through the years, fans seeking fidelity to the comics have had reason to be wary and suspicious of Hollywood.The key window for Batman in comics came in the 1970s, which marked shift from the lightness and camp that characterized the 1960s \"Batman\" TV show -- with its \"Wap! Bam! Pow!\" graphics -- to a darker vision of the caped vigilante.Read More\"The Batman,\" starring Robert Pattinson, represents the latest screen incarnation of the character, and in many ways feels designed to tap into the desires of that ardent fan base. Brooding and serious, the film caters to those weaned on Batman as a creature of the night, an image honed by comic-book artists Marshall Rogers and Neal Adams in the '70s, and Frank Miller in the landmark graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns.\"Director/co-writer Matt Reeves has cited another comic written by Miller, \"Batman: Year One,\" which captures an early stage in his crimefighting career, among his inspirations.Ben Affleck as Batman in 'Zack Snyder's Justice League.'Those comics evolved Batman's profile toward a more adult tone that informed director Tim Burton's 1989 movie. Yet even with its success, sequels directed by the late Joel Schumacher -- starring Val Kilmer, and then George Clooney -- revived the kind of broader camp that many comics fans saw as the bad old days.Christopher Nolan rectified that with his trilogy of \"Batman Begins,\" \"The Dark Knight\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" which featured Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning take on the Joker -- the kind of prestige that usually eludes superhero fare.But reinvention has always been a part of Batman's screen incarnations. Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Picture Group (like CNN, part of WarnerMedia), recently told the New York Times that Reeves' challenge was to \"create a Batman that is compelling and dynamic and thrilling, but different than anything we've seen before.\"While the movie is assured of a big opening weekend, how well it lasts will be determined not just by how committed fans respond, but whether those less invested join them in marching back to theaters.When Affleck was selected, CNN's Jake Tapper jokingly introduced a segment on the overheated response as \"the debate tearing this country apart: Batfleck.\" The next year, Affleck conceded to Entertainment Weekly that Warner Bros. warned him about possible blowback, quoting studio brass as saying, \"Are you sure you want to get into this? This is part and parcel of these movies now. There's a lot of active fans with a lot of opinions.\" Social media has fueled that dynamic, creating echo chambers where those holding \"a lot of opinions\" can commiserate with like-minded souls, or conversely, argue with dissenters.The loudest voices, of course, aren't always the most representative, especially with something like Batman. But they do reflect why that Bat-signal occupies such a distinctive place in pop culture: Because so many people think they know what's right for the character, believing that he -- no matter who wears the costume -- belongs to them."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "7"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Pixar has a knack for coming-of-age tales, but few that mix the touching and adorable much better than \"Turning Red,\" a bright and appealing animated movie somewhat surprisingly headed directly to Disney+.

Audiences should still warm to this mother-daughter story on streaming, but in bypassing theaters it feels like the studio is leaving some green on the table.Directed and co-written by Domee Shi (the theatrical short \"Bao\"), the film tells the story of 13-year-old Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose family runs a Chinese temple in Toronto. An honor student who craves the approval of her mother (Sandra Oh), Mei has a trio of close friends with whom she shares a passion for a boy group named 4*town, which will soon be playing a concert in her town.Budding boy mania, however, triggers another unexpected response: Mei's transformation into a furry Red Panda, a legacy of her family's mystical history. The parallels between that and the advent of puberty are unavoidable, and Shi and co-writer Julie Cho hilariously lean into them, with Mei's introduction to dawning womanhood bringing with it a series of mortifying side effects.In tone and style, \"Turning Red\" perhaps most closely resembles \"Inside Out,\" another Pixar film that did an inordinately good job of addressing the pangs of this particular age in a sprightly and entertaining package. Here, the add-ons include not only a generational clash but the weight of expectations that Mei faces, trying to satisfy her mother as she begins to exhibit signs of independence.\"Turning Red\" also gets a whole lot of mileage out of the panda gags, which, in the crassest commercial terms, should sell a whole lot of plush toys to younger tykes.Read MoreLike the best Pixar fare, the film operates on multiple levels, in ways that will be relatable to parents and older kids that are both culturally specific and broadly universal, with the added garnish of original songs by Billie Eilish.Animation has obviously been a major driver for Disney+ over the past two years, at a time when the streaming service needed content and viewers were hungry for escapes at home.Whether that logic holds as theaters are opening up is between Pixar and Disney's accounting teams, but the lack of a theatrical window right now is puzzling, with a movie that's qualitatively in the conversation with the Oscar-winning \"Soul,\" and a cut above recent releases \"Luca\" and \"Onward.\"Still, wherever one sees it, \"Turning Red\" delivers an exquisitely animated story that's moving as well as funny -- welcome evidence that creatively speaking, at least, Pixar hasn't lost its golden touch.\"Turning Red\" premieres March 11 on Disney+."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "17"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Amy Schumer titled her sketch comedy series \"Inside Amy Schumer,\" which would actually be a better moniker for \"Life & Beth,\" a Hulu dramedy that Schumer created and stars in, in addition to writing and directing most of the episodes.

Personal but ponderous, it's a flawed trip down memory lane where children bear the lingering burden of their ill-equipped parents.Schumer's Beth seems to have a lot going for her as the series begins, with a longterm boyfriend and perq-filled job as a wine distributor, before being suddenly shaken by an unexpected loss. That event throws Beth into a tailspin, causing her to begin questioning her choices and reminiscing about painful memories from her youth (she's well played at that age by Violet Young).Most of those interludes demonstrate how cruel kids can be, capturing awkward and embarrassing moments in Beth's adolescence. But several deal with Beth's divorced parents, and especially her beautiful mom (Laura Benanti), who attracted men in droves and discarded them just as quickly.As for the present, Beth's relationship fizzles but she soon meets a taciturn farmer (Michael Cera, at his Michael Cera-est), who is brusque at first before the two become romantically entangled. Their interactions get complicated by her sudden interest in reexamining her life, which frequently puts more emphasis on drama, albeit not very well, than comedy.\"Do you ever hear yourself?\" Beth's younger sister (Susannah Flood) asks, and clearly, much of the time she doesn't. Therein lies one of the show's drawbacks, which is that even with the cruel blow life has dealt her, Beth comes across as self-absorbed in a way that exhibits little awareness that others might be hurting too.Read MoreAfter starring in several movies, and with her gig co-hosting the Oscars coming up, Schumer attracts some marquee names, with David Byrne and Jonathan Groff among the guest stars, and Benanti lighting up the flashbacks as the mother that young Beth alternately loves and can't stand.Just structurally, \"Life & Beth\" is such a slender premise as to feel conspicuously stretched at 10 episodes, putting Beth's new relationship through various contortions seemingly as a means of prolonging it.All told, the Hulu series provides Schumer -- who has begun making the turn into dramatic fare, including the recent movie \"The Humans\" -- a wide berth to explore material loosely based on her own experiences. (Schumer also produced a reality show for HBO Max, \"Expecting Amy,\" chronicling her difficult pregnancy.)There's obviously a long history of filmmakers engaging in similar exercises, just as there is in comics branching out into more serious fare; still, the stark rawness of the material doesn't translate into a particularly distinctive series.\"Life & Beth\" eventually comes around to recognizing that despite hardship and setbacks, life goes on.

And after record-low ratings in 2021, the old adage about the Lord helping those who help themselves comes to mind.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is surely feeling pressure to breathe some life back into ratings for the Oscars, and part of that plan has logically involved nominating movies that more people have actually seen. Yet despite expanding the best-picture category to 10 nominees, few of the major contenders in the nominations unveiled Tuesday morning meet that description -- especially if it means having seen those films in theaters.Before the nominations, producer Cassian Elwes -- known for smaller-scale films like \"Mudbound\" and \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" -- tweeted that it was \"shortsighted\" for the Producers Guild's awards to overlook \"the two terrific movies that saved the theatrical business this year,\" \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" and \"No Time to Die.\"If you subscribe to that theory, the Oscars will be inordinately reliant on movies that have primarily reached audiences through streaming, with two Netflix titles, \"Don't Look Up\" and \"The Power of the Dog,\" among the 10 nominees, joined by Apple's \"Coda,\" and \"King Richard\" and \"Dune,\" which premiered simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. (The last two are from Warner Bros., like CNN, part of WarnerMedia.)As for the aforementioned movies that \"saved the theatrical business,\" \"Spider-Man\" -- currently the fourth biggest domestic box-office release of all time -- received a lone nomination for visual effects, while Daniel Craig's final appearance as 007 was recognized for best song, sound and visual effects.Read MoreGranted, the belief that popular movies are key to boosting Oscar ratings doesn't always hold true, although the most-watched telecast ever remains the year that \"Titanic\" sailed away with best picture. Yet it seems undeniable that hit films broadly help, giving potential viewers more of a rooting interest in who and what wins.Mindful of that, the Academy flirted with introducing a \"popular film\" category in 2018, seeking to add a more populist streak to the ceremony. After members shot down the idea for various (mostly logical) reasons, the organization opted to expand the best picture category to 10 movies, in part hoping that at least a few widely seen titles would sneak into the mix.Smaller movies, however, have generally prevailed. And part of the challenge that the Oscars and the movie business face has stemmed from the consumer pivot to streaming, a trend that was already growing before being dramatically hastened by the global pandemic.Hidetoshi Nishijima and T\u00f4ko Miura in 'Drive My Car,' which received Oscar nominations for best picture and international film.For theaters worried about their future, the fact that people interested in catching up on nominees will find \"The Power of the Dog\" (this year's most-nominated title, with 12) and \"Don't Look Up\" on Netflix -- along with others that earned major nominations, including \"Tick, Tick ... Boom!\" and \"The Lost Daughter\" -- won't ease those concerns.Because streamers generally don't provide detailed viewing data, it's unclear how many people have seen some of these movies, but they're obviously being watched via those platforms in vast numbers. Witness the Billboard-topping songs from \"Encanto,\" a nominee for best animated movie, which took off once that title landed on Disney+.While blockbusters (other than the sci-fi epic \"Dune,\" a more modest box-office performer) remain scarce in the best-picture category, the Academy did recognize an international movie, Japan's critical darling \"Drive My Car,\" as well as its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi. That follows the historic best-picture win by \"Parasite\" two years ago.In addition, the Danish animated documentary \"Flee\" registered an impressive showing, notching nominations in the animated, documentary and international film categories.The Academy's ongoing efforts to be more representative in terms of diversity and inconclusion continue to yield mixed results, with some notable oversights (see Ruth Negga for Netflix's \"Passing\") but major acting nominations for Denzel Washington (\"The Tragedy of Macbeth\"), Ariana DeBose (\"West Side Story\"), and Will Smith and Aunjanue Ellis (\"King Richard\").Inevitably, the omissions will receive as much attention as the nominees, but by now it should be clear that the Oscars can never please everybody, especially with 10 best-picture nominees and only five slots for directors.Whether that somewhat disjointed roster adds up to a menu that will lure back more viewers remains to be seen. But if the Academy does see ratings rebound, the hero will be streaming, not Spider-Man."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "9"}, "text": {"headline": "africa", "text": "Amazon Prime Video has secured deals with Nigerian studios Inkblot Productions and Anthill Studios, which could shake up the local film industry.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)In its hunt for content, Amazon Prime Video has turned to Nigeria, where it has secured key deals with studios that could shake up business in Africa's most prolific filmmaking hub.In recent months, the US giant has signed exclusive streaming agreements with Inkblot Productions and Anthill Studios -- which say the deals will fundamentally change the way they operate.

Akinmolayan believes the Nigerian diaspora will be the primary beneficiary of the new content, explaining that awareness of the subscription service in Nigeria was not high. \"Very few people know that they can actually download the Amazon app and pay for it here,\" he says, \"that's because Amazon hasn't fully unleashed a plan for (the service).\"In the meantime, the deals could have an impact on domestic cinemas.Anthill's deal involves separate licenses for each film, the value of which is determined in part by the film's theatrical box office.

He describes Inkblot's audience as \"both discerning and forgiving,\" given the huge budget disparities between homegrown titles and foreign movies.\"You have to deliver entertainment that is on a commensurate scale to what Hollywood films are doing,\" he explains. \"You can't meet the spectacle, but you can meet the truth: what it means to be a Nigerian; what it means for people to see themselves on screen ... That is something that, no matter what their budget is, (no) Hollywood title can compete (with).\" That said, \"when you're a Nigerian film and you're competing with a Marvel film, you can only pray,\" jokes Akinmolayan.The next chapterThe next stage of Prime Video's move into the African market is already underway. Lonian said discussions on developing and commissioning Amazon Originals -- series or films produced or co-produced by Amazon -- were taking place with producers and talent. \"We attended the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF) in November to start really meaningful engagement with the production industry in Africa,\" she added. \"Our message is that we're very much open for business.\"Akinmolayan behind the camera on a recent production.For Anthill and Inkblot, their immediate focus is on their upcoming slates.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \n\n\n\n\nI confess to being old enough to have watched the premiere of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1975. It was, from the start, exciting, ground-breaking television.Since then, I have seen the majority of episodes. Not all of them, of course, because like most \"SNL\" viewers, I have found some periods in its mostly spectacular history more appealing (as in, funnier) than others.I have never held the fallow periods against the show, because the show's creative maestro, Lorne Michaels, somehow always manages to find the way back to relevance and inspired comedy. (You're not going to stay on the air for nearly 50 years if you can't.)So I feel reasonably well-equipped to say: The current season, which has reached its holiday hiatus point, can be legitimately ranked with past examples (Season 26 in 2000 when Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon teamed up on Weekend Update; Season 21 in 1995 when Will Ferrell and others joined the cast) as a genuine comeback story.I'm not alone. Reviews for this season have been substantially positive. A typical comment, this one from Kelly Lawler at USA Today: \"'SNL' this season so far has been unexpectedly hilarious, delightful and thrilling.\" Read MoreThat's not an appraisal \"SNL\" was routinely receiving in recent years, when criticism was lobbed at the show for being creatively stalled. So what changed?The most obvious answer: we are not in the middle of a presidential race. \"SNL\" has always thrived on political satire; parodies of debates and other campaign moments have generated some of its most memorable sketches and catchphrases: \"Strategery\" from Will Ferrell as George Bush in 2000; \"I can see Russia from my house!\" from Tina Fey as Sarah Palin in 2008; \"Who am I? Why am I here?\" from Phil Hartman as Admiral James Stockdale in 1992. And when Donald Trump emerged as candidate and then president, the show experienced a jolt of positive attention from Alec Baldwin's extremely broad Trump impression.Bowen Yang as the Iceberg that sank the Titanic, left, and anchor Colin Jost during Weekend Update on \"Saturday Night Live\" in New York on April 10, 2021. But as has happened with \"SNL\" in the past, expectations that the show must jump on every egregious event coming out of Washington sometimes winds up forcing creative decisions. In the case of Trump, there were a slew of those events, many so closely resembling the theater of the absurd they were almost impossible to parody (drinking bleach; redrawing weather maps; Mexico paying for the wall).In the last few years of Trump-centric news, \"SNL\" seemed to exhaust itself in search of a fresh comic take, something other than how ridiculous or menacing Trump could be.It didn't help that the entire world of late-night was equally suffused in Trump-preposterousness, because of comedy imperatives and the conviction that his actions had to be mocked.This season has brought the first sustained respite from Trump in seven years. The character has appeared, but sparingly, and the impression, performed by new cast member James Austin Johnson, is more character than caricature. Johnson is capturing the Trump voice and mannerisms as they really are, not as a cartoonish performance. (Baldwin, to be fair, was very funny in many sketches in the early Trump years.)Notably, the show has also done little of substance with Joe Biden, though Johnson also has a skillful take on him. Jim Carrey was an exceptional bit of star-casting, but he didn't knock critics out.Perhaps because of the huge focus on politics, or because the cast has not been the most memorable, Michaels did a lot of that stunt-casting in recent years, especially in bringing back cast favorites. But the best seasons of \"SNL\" have been all about the regular cast.Late-night television may never be the sameAnd that's what has been happening this year. Some relatively newer cast members are moving to the forefront. Bowen Yang is proving extremely versatile; and Pete Davidson, who earlier leaned heavily on his stand-up skills, has made a mark with well-formed sketch characters (his Andrew Cuomo is dead-on great) and in music videos. (The \"Walking in Staten\" parody of \"Walking in Memphis\" is a highlight of this season.)But there have been other highlights, some generated by hosts, many of whom excelled this season. Maybe most surprising was Kim Kardashian, who defied expectations by shining in her appearance. (One line from her monologue: \"I'm just so much more than that reference photo my sisters showed their plastic surgeons.\") Kieran Culkin and Simu Liu were also very busy in their stints, a sign the writers saw real comedy chops. So was Billie Eilish, who had a highlight commercial parody on top of two eye-popping music performances.Still, by almost universal agreement, the standout performance of the season was turned in by long-time cast member Cecily Strong, with an impassioned Weekend Update segment as Goober the clown, a searingly funny commentary about abortion rights.Weekend Update also seems refreshed. After some seasons where the jokes felt flat, they have been sharp and more frequently laugh-out-loud: \"An 83-year-old man has become the oldest person ever to hike the Appalachian Trail.

On different days, that might be \"Porgy and Bess;\" \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" reprising his part in from the play about a struggling Chicago family; or \"The Defiant Ones,\" which earned him his first best-actor Oscar nomination as an escapee on the run chained to a Southern bigot played by Tony Curtis. (In a loaded year, both Curtis and Poitier earned nominations, along with Spencer Tracy and Paul Newman, but the award went to David Niven for \"Separate Tables.\")Those movies only scratch the surface of a half-century of screen work, which helped pave a path for other performers of color -- a burden  the actor bore with considerable grace, despite the challenges and strictures he faced.As Variety's Tim Gray noted in framing the decades when Poitier's career peaked, the US Supreme Court ruling against miscegenation laws in Loving v.

Here, Glenn Ford played the teacher trying to break through to the kids, with Vic Morrow as the worst of the bad apples.Edge of the City (1956): The pairing of Poitier and John Cassavetes as two longshoremen, with Jack Warden as a truly hissable villain, elevates this film from director Martin Ritt. Like many prominent roles for Black actors in this period, the arc of Poitier's character, alas, existed largely to set up a moral dilemma for his co-star to confront.A Patch of Blue (1965): Poitier starred opposite Elizabeth Hartman as a blind woman whom he befriends (the title describes her last memory of vision), while Shelley Winters earned an Academy Award as one of the world's worst mothers.They Call Me Mister Tibbs! (1970) and The Organization (1971): After the success of \"In the Heat of the Night,\" Poitier returned in two standard but enjoyable sequels as Virgil Tibbs, the big-city detective, with the first capitalizing on one of the more memorable movie lines from the 1960s.Buck and the Preacher (1972) and Uptown Saturday Night (1974) and): Poitier not only starred in but directed both of these films, playing opposite Harry Belafonte in a western and Bill Cosby in a light comedy-action vehicle, which was successful enough to spawn a pair of re-teamings with Cosby, the appropriately titled \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action.\" His work behind the scenes also included directing \"Stir Crazy,\" the prison comedy with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor.Separate But Equal (1991): Moving to TV, Poitier played future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in this ABC miniseries about the Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954, also featuring Burt Lancaster in his final role.Sneakers (1992): A disposable but extremely fun caper film with an excellent cast that featured Poitier and Robert Redford as part of an elite security team.

The play turned movie under many different guises now adds a film version of the musical, \"Cyrano,\" which provides a fine showcase for Peter Dinklage in a different take on the tortured hero but doesn't hit enough high notes to distinguish its unstained plume.Dinklage trades in the customary prosthetic nose for his stature, which provides the impediment here to expressing his love for his cousin Roxanne (Haley Bennett), whose fondness for him is strictly platonic.But of course, Roxanne has fallen for the handsome Christian (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), who despite his striking features lacks confidence or style when it comes to the art of romance. The awkward solution is for Cyrano to write to her (and in the famous balcony scene, speak for him), expressing his love for Roxanne without revealing the source or his true feelings.It's a hard story to screw up, and director Joe Wright (\"Atonement,\" and more recently \"Darkest Hour\") doesn't.

The movie received an Oscar-qualifying run -- its lone nomination coming for costume design -- then had its official release delayed due to the Omicron variant. It thus arrives later and with less fanfare than the producers clearly hoped.Thanks to the cast (which also includes Ben Mendelsohn, near-unrecognizable as the villainous De Guiche), \"Cyrano\" is worth seeing, either now or later.

That's probably enough for Netflix coming off a success with Reynolds in \"Red Notice,\" but like the film's plot, this amounts to rehashing history.Reynolds neatly sums up \"The Adam Project's\" modest ambitions in the production notes, saying that the concept \"ticked every box for us.\" That means giving the star a chance to be heroic and funny, while adding a dollop of heart that borders a bit too much on sappiness.The producers were equally shrewd in the casting, having Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo playing the Reynolds character's parents, serving up a bonus reunion of the 2004 rom-com \"13 Going on 30.\"That said, the central relationship is actually between Reynolds' Adam and his 12-year-old self, played by Walker Scobell.Having lost his dad, the young Adam is warned by his mom that \"The future is coming sooner than you think,\" but that can't possibly prepare him for what happens next: The elder Adam blasts into our time from 2050, employing time-travel technology to try stopping a villain (Catherine Keener) by altering the past in order to change the future.Read MoreThe kid not surprisingly has several million questions, and seems amusingly pleased that his scrawny, bullied self has grown up to be an accomplished pilot who's resourceful in a fight and not incidentally pretty ripped. (Reynolds, of course, played a pilot in \"Green Lantern\" before another superhero, \"Deadpool,\" firmly established his current brand.)\"We've seen 'Terminator,' right?\" the older version asks the younger one, capturing the general irreverence toward the science-fiction underpinnings of the enterprise, which rather unabashedly approaches the time-travel aspect as a fertile comedic device and an opportunity to explore heart-tugging moments regarding family and words left unspoken.The back-from-the-future premise also includes a subplot involving Adam's lost wife (Zoe Salda\u00f1a, adding another Marvel veteran in a smallish role) and leads to some inordinately bad computer-generated de-aging graphics, the kind of shortcoming that's mildly distracting but easily ignored.Indeed, the underlying strength of \"The Adam Project\" is that it keeps serving notice not to overthink things, but rather to sit back and enjoy Reynolds' banter with his younger self as well as the colorful action.It's passable on those terms, but not much more than that, reflecting the pitfalls of Netflix's current movie strategy, which beyond a handful of prestige awards-seeking titles seemingly consists of attracting big promotable stars and volume, volume, volume.\"The Adam Project\" recalls the past in cinematic terms by feeling conspicuously like what used to be dubbed a \"B\" movie, a genre that no longer has much traction in theaters.

Yet this quarter-century-later \"requel\" (a term specifically explained in the movie) turns out to be a great deal of fun, cleverly wedding familiar faces with new stars in what isn't exactly a remake or reboot but rather plays like a refresh.Horror has been one of the more reliable subgenres during the pandemic, but the current Omicron wave has complicated the calculus. Still, wherever people wind up seeing this designed-to-please slasher movie -- even if that's minus a crowd -- it should possess a healthy shelf life.Half the battle was won, in hindsight, during the casting, tapping Melissa Barrera (\"In the Heights\"), Jenna Ortega (\"Stuck in the Middle\") and Jack Quaid (\"The Boys\") for key roles among the younger contingent, while bringing back Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette in their original roles.The trick comes in replicating elements of the original by the late director Wes Craven (to whom the movie's dedicated) and writer Kevin Williamson -- a horror flick that actually runs down the rules for surviving a horror flick, then watches the characters break them anyway -- updating that by overlaying the new on the old.All that's achieved, fairly impressively, while simultaneously lampooning the original, its three sequels and that 25-year relationship with the audience, but still treating it with a level of every-detail-counts earnestness generally reserved for movies with superheroes or spaceships. Plus, there are plenty of references to recent horror movies, their varying levels of ambition and where \"Scream\" fits in.Read MoreIt spoils nothing to say the basic template remains intact, with an incident involving Ortega's character bringing her older sister (Barrera) back to the town of Woodsboro, accompanied by her boyfriend (Quaid). An earlier killing spree there prompted a series of movies, meaning this Ghostface killer is tapping into that mythology, leaving no shortage of suspects or bodies.The newbies get the bright idea of seeking out advice from old pros, which is where Arquette, Cox and Campbell come into the picture, however grudgingly.Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett deliver the requisite gore by the bucket, never letting an open door -- closet, refrigerator, you name it -- go unexploited in terms of trying to milk a jump or scare out of it.As noted, venerable horror franchises like \"Halloween\" have managed to lure people to theaters during this challenging time, bucking the overall trend.That might not rate high in the rules for surviving a pandemic, but it bodes pretty well for \"Scream\" proving successful enough to rise again, whether that's a sequel, remake, reboot, or as in this case, essentially all of the above.\"Scream\" premieres in US theaters on Jan. 14.

In a movie that hinges on an impulsive decision, it's hard not to wish somebody had spent at least a little more time agonizing about the script, which is actually based on a graphic novel.Lopez's Kat Valdez is on top of the world, about to marry fellow musical superstar Bastian (played by singer Maluma) during a televised concert. The made-for-TV nuptials will serve the dual purpose of promoting their single \"Marry Me,\" illustrating how she leads her life completely in the public eye.Confronted by the news that Bastian cheated on her, she decides to take what she later describes as \"a leap of faith\" by proceeding with the wedding ceremony by plucking a divorced math teacher, Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson), out of the crowd.Read MoreJennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson in 'Marry Me.'It is, as she acknowledges, an \"insane situation,\" one that her loyal manager (\"Game of Thrones'\" John Bradley) is eager to make go away. But of course, the plot calls for Kat and Charlie to try maintaining the pretense of a connection a few months for face-saving purposes, just long enough for the pop princess and public-school proctor to begin appreciating each other's qualities, with the threat that she might reconcile with Bastian looming over the nascent relationship.A nice guy and a single dad, Charlie is quick to admit that \"I don't fit\" in Kat's under-the-spotlight sphere, which hinges to an unhealthy degree on live streams and followers. The Universal release also goes out of its way to synergistically incorporate sister NBC properties, with \"Today's\" Hoda Kotb and \"The Tonight Show's\" Jimmy Fallon receiving nearly as much screen time as any of the supporting players except perhaps Bradley and Sarah Silverman as Charlie's friend and coworker.Marking the feature debut for TV director Kat Coiro (\"Dead to Me\" and the upcoming \"She-Hulk\"), \"Marry Me\" conjures a few sweet moments, lots of music, and a \"King for a Day\" quality in Charlie's plight, with Kat's jet-setting lifestyle and paparazzi suddenly stalking his every move.A genre reborn: Inside the evolution of the rom-comYet while the movie is unabashed about its rom-com roots, such fare isn't exactly rare these days, having simply migrated from theaters to venues like Netflix, which seems to churn them out in bunches.

And if award voters have any interest in recognizing movies that people have seen -- and will thus harbor some rooting interest in the choices -- the calculus needs to shift to how many watched them, not strictly how many have directly paid for the privilege.Netflix and other streaming services don't provide much help in issuing clear data that possesses the simplicity of perusing a box-office chart.

The New York Times, for example, recently fretted about what sluggish box-office figures mean for award shows, in an article headlined, \"The Oscars Want Crowd-Pleasers, but Where Are the Crowds?\"Read MoreThe \"crowds,\" pretty obviously, are at home, scattered from communal viewing to consume entertainment on their schedules. And that has produced \"crowd-pleasers,\" or at least movies that have generated buzz, just as Netflix intended when it embarked on the mission of seeking to establish its movies as credible award candidates, after growing to rival HBO in TV's awards race.Tom Holland and Benedict Cumberbatch in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home.'Indeed, the only genuine \"crowd-pleaser\" to speak of this year, in the conventional sense, is \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" the $1-billion-plus international hit, which appears destined to join the rarefied $700-million club in terms of domestic box-office grosses occupied by \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" \"Avengers: Endgame,\" \"Avatar\" and \"Black Panther.\"After flirting in 2018 with introducing a \"popular film\" category to bring such blockbusters into the Oscar ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences took the next best step, expanding the field of best-picture contenders to 10, theoretically opening up slots for more widely-seen movies.Such plans don't always work out, but with \"Spider-Man\" propping up the theatrical movie business almost single-handedly, if ever there was a year to invite a superhero to Hollywood's biggest party, it's this one.Otherwise, the power in this year's awards race resides in movies that have made a splash in streaming, including others that notched significant Globes wins: Amazon's \"Being the Ricardos\" for star Nicole Kidman, Will Smith in \"King Richard\" (which surely fared better on HBO Max than it did at the box office), and Andrew Garfield for his role in Netflix's musical \"Tick, Tick ... Boom!\"Whether that math persists forever is unknown, but for now, \"The Power of the Dog\" is the sort of \"hit,\" however fuzzy the streaming data, which could help bring additional sizzle to an awards system challenged on multiple fronts.The Golden Globes have been a mess, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association that presents them remains enmeshed in the process of cleaning up its collective act.

Boom!,\" a loving adaptation of \"Rent\" creator Jonathan Larson's coming-of-stage story, and written eight original songs for \"Encanto,\" a Disney animated film featuring a predominantly Latinx cast. That follows another animated movie, Netflix's \"Vivo,\" which he produced in addition to writing the music.Although he is working from a script by Steve Levenson (\"Dear Evan Hansen\"), Miranda has clearly approached \"Tick, Tick\" as a deeply personal ode to musical theater in general and in particular Larson, who tragically died on the eve of what would become \"Rent's\" record-breaking run at the age of 35.Deftly expanding the source material into a movie, the film is anchored by a sensational performance by Andrew Garfield as Larson, with the title referring to the sense that his bravado about becoming \"the future of musical theater\" is running dry, with timing running out, in his eyes, as he approaches his 30th birthday.Capturing the creative process on film also poses a tricky proposition, but Miranda mostly manages to do just that, while conveying the palpable anxiety that Larson feels about at what point he transitions from being a writer who waits tables to make ends meet to becoming \"a waiter with a hobby.\"Read MoreThe echoes of \"Rent\" throughout are also everywhere, reflecting how Larson eventually went from trying to sell an esoteric concept set in the future to writing about subjects very close to home, including struggles to keep the lights on (literally) and the ravages of AIDS at the time.\"Tick, Tick ...

The main departure, and it's an interesting one, is the lack of a traditional villain, an absence that's felt but mostly overcome by the warmth and energy behind the execution, which effectively draws audiences into the story.Set in a magical town in Colombia, Disney's 60th animated feature begins with a nod to a particularly sober real-world phenomenon -- namely, the plight of refugees. But amid their loss comes the magic that has made the Madrigal family flourish, with each possessing a remarkable gift under the watchful eye of matriarch Alma (Mar\u00eda Cecilia Botero).Everyone, that is, except Mirabel (\"Brooklyn Nine-Nine's\" Stephanie Beatriz), who emerged empty-handed from the gifting ritual, still determined  to be as much a part of the family as her parents and sisters.\"Gift or no gift, I am just as special as the rest of my family,\" Mirabel tells the local children, but she seems as doubtful of the truth of that as they are.Still, just as one of Mirabel's cousins comes of age and her sister is about to marry, strange things start happening, with signs that the family's magic is beginning to fade. Mirabel thus becomes the Cassandra warning of danger, something her grandma has no interest in hearing, merely reinforcing Miirabel's sense that it has fallen to her to save everyone.Directed Jared Bush and Byron Howard (\"Zootopia\") and co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, \"Encanto\" compensates for the dearth of traditional conflict with a colorful world filled with powers and an abundance of music.\"I will never be good enough for you,\" an exasperated Mirabel says at one point.Happily, \"Encanto\" is plenty good enough for families seeking a sprinkle of that Disney animated magic, just as is \"Tick, Tick ... Boom!\" brings theater into the home.\"Tick, Tick ... Boom!\" premieres Nov. 19 on Netflix. \"Encanto\" premieres in US theaters on Nov. 24.

Dramas and more serious movies were already migrating to streaming, but even titles designed as popcorn-selling crowd pleasers have struggled as theaters have sought to recover.One blockbuster won't be enough to turn back the clock or drive scary headlines about the latest Covid variant out of people's minds. Yet seeing \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" early at an industry screening -- normally a more jaded assembly than an opening-night crowd -- brought back some of the particular joys associated with watching movies in a communal setting.At key moments, there were whoops, cheers and appreciative laughs -- loud in places, more muted in others where the references surely played to a subsection of the audience. After attending screenings for months in sparsely populated theaters to allow for social distancing, the experience felt like a reminder of how certain kinds of movies benefit from being shared.Read MoreThe audience reaction didn't match \"Avengers: Endgame\" in its boisterousness, but it did bring to mind that moment early in the pandemic when video circulated of an audience going wild at its climactic sequence.Zendaya and Tom Holland in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home.'Last year the directors of the film, Joe and Anthony Russo, talked about how emotional that clip was, with the latter saying that while the business was changing, seeing movies with large groups \"is always going to be unique, in the way watching something at home can't be.\"Although there have been some successes during the pandemic, there's a growing sense that the movie industry might never fully rebound to where it was in 2019. But something like \"Spider-Man\" nevertheless represents a reassuring feeling that the hunger for what theaters offer can't be entirely replaced.Back when one of the last major network hits, \"The Big Bang Theory,\" went off the air in 2019, series producer/co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that those writing obituaries for the sitcom were doing so prematurely.\"I've been doing this long enough to know I've heard the bold statement that 'This is it.

So humility would suggest that making a blanket statement, that this is the end, is probably foolish.\"Hollywood can't pivot on a dime, but the forecast for movies in theaters has become even more Darwinian, favoring a very select few that meet the criteria to qualify as an event. For every \"Spider-Man\" or \"The Batman\" there will be expensive failures, and as a consequence the gap between theatrical winners and those that must rely on home exhibition -- and generally speaking, tighter budgets -- appears destined to grow.At this point, \"Spider-Man's\" success looks like a welcome spike on a troubling EKG -- a short-term jolt to the movie business and avid theater-goers, not an enduring rescue.But for this weekend, anyway, as millions flock to the movies, it's nice to see that the pipes still work.

That it was made for a streaming service, Amazon, is a wrinkle even the legendarily foresighted Desi Arnaz surely couldn't have imagined.In a clever framing device, Sorkin builds the narrative around a \"scary week\" in the lives of Lucille Ball (Nicole Kidman) and her husband/co-star Arnaz (Javier Bardem), as filtered through the recollections of those who worked on their top-rated sitcom, \"I Love Lucy.\" The film then uses that confined window to revisit the couple's courtship and how they conquered TV through a series of deftly constructed flashbacks.The crises for the duo emerge on two fronts: An anonymous item from radio star Walter Winchell implying that Ball is a communist (there's an explanation, but not one that might satisfy red-baiting critics or nervous network executives); and tabloid photos of Arnaz with another woman, fueling Lucy's suspicions, despite his denials, about the philandering that would eventually break them apart.Those elements really define the film, much more than the casting and absurd sight-unseen second-guessing that it triggered. As for that, Kidman might not particularly resemble Lucy but she utterly captures her creative genius, imperious demeanor in dealing with the writers -- executive producer Jess Oppenheimer (Tony Hale) absorbs the brunt of the abuse -- and her show-first attitude, even if that meant relegating co-star Vivian Vance (Nina Arianda) to frumpy frocks that she hated.When they meet Desi instantly recognizes her talent, calling her \"kinetically gifted,\" skills that would later be put to good use in the show's ample slapstick. As for her cold-blooded demeanor and recognition of the clout the pair wielded at that moment, it's best summed up by a scene when somebody asks her if she's joking.Read MoreNicole Kidman and Javier Bardem play Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in 'Being the Ricardos' (Glen Wilson/Amazon Content Services).\"I'm Lucille Ball,\" she responds icily. \"When I'm being funny you'll know it.\"The underlying conceit behind \"Being the Ricardos\" is that despite their success, Ball and Arnaz's future faced real jeopardy during that week, creating a tension among the staff and cast that brought out the best and worst in everybody. That includes a spectacularly funny supporting turn by J.K. Simmons as co-star William Frawley, who references his vaudeville career and boasts about drinking excessively without actually getting drunk.Counting Lucy and Desi's kids among its producers, \"Being the Ricardos\" treats both gently but doesn't whitewash the relationship or characters, including the fact that Lucy went into television in order to keep her husband at home and ultimately still couldn't save the marriage.\"Every decision I make is based on being near you,\" she insists, during an earlier moment when the prospect of more film work beckons.Throughout his career Sorkin has exhibited a knack for capturing both the artistic process, which is difficult to put on film, and the high-stakes world of television. Although he has more recently gravitated to movies that previously took place primarily on TV in \"Sports Night,\" \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" and \"The Newsroom.\"No matter how many times you've watched those classic \"I Love Lucy\" episodes (or not at all), it's likely you'll come away from \"Being the Ricardos\" with a greater appreciation for the central couple's talents as well as their personal failings and foibles.

At roughly $7 a month, that's a whole lot of credits, and \"Star Wars\" shows, like \"The Mandalorian,\" are obviously a major part of that.Read MoreStill, Disney is in the theatrical business as well, where hits have become increasingly elusive, a trend that preceded the pandemic but that has been significantly exacerbated by it. Increasingly, there appears to be a very narrow tier of blockbusters -- \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" and \"The Batman\" among the recent examples -- that can overcome the gravitational pull of streaming's tractor beam. For everything else, it's wait until Netflix or one of its competitors offers it.Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the upcoming Disney+ series.An Obi-Wan Kenobi movie, starring McGregor, would seem to have the combination of elements to clear that hurdle. Instead, the studio opted to go the Disney+ route after the disappointing box-office performance by \"Solo,\" a 2018 prequel that cast Alden Ehrenreich in the title role.At the time, Collider reported that Disney and Lucasfilm had decided to put all the \"Star Wars\" spinoff movies \"on hold\" because of \"Solo's\" commercial misfire, which prompted headlines like \"'Solo' Is Officially the First 'Star Wars' Movie to Flop.\" That included what was then planned to be an Obi-Wan feature.\"I just think that we might've put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast,\" Disney's then-CEO, Bob Iger, told the New York Times.Saturating the market was likely a factor. Arguably, though, the studio might have overreacted, in the process underestimating the appeal of the Kenobi character and the lure of having McGregor (as opposed to a recast newcomer) reprise the role.While it's fun to speculate and play \"What if?,\" it will be virtually impossible to sort out whether Disney left money on the outer rim by producing a limited series instead of a movie. People sign up and maintain streaming subscriptions for all sorts of content, although it seems fair to surmise that \"Star Wars\" fans won't cancel Disney+ any time before \"Kenobi\" finishes its run.The series, incidentally, premieres on May 25, which happens to be the 45th anniversary of the Jedi knight's debut in \"Star Wars,\" back in the day before chapter subheads were involved, when people's at-home alternatives were mostly limited to the three broadcast networks.Would a Kenobi movie, released on that anniversary with the kind of trailer that just broke the internet, bring people out to theaters today?

In fact, while the \"Everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes\" quote might have been misattributed to the artist, with most episodes running more than an hour, \"Diaries\" adds 395 minutes to Warhol's tally, for whatever that's worth.Rossi uses the posthumously published diaries as the program's narrative spine, while darting about in a manner that represents the chaotic times during which Warhol lived, the lives he touched, and the various contradictions associated with him.Straddling cultural spheres, Warhol could popularize Campbell's soup cans or befriend and champion talents like Jean-Michel Basquiat (the subject of an entire episode); turn out cutting-edge movies, as well as pioneering videos for a then-nascent MTV; and still incongruously appear as a guest in mainstream vehicles like \"Love Boat\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\"Few personalities have possessed such range, and the breadth of Warhol's reach and influence is only rivaled by the name-dropping in the diaries -- including those who lined up for his celebrity portraits -- a list as impressive as it is exhausting.Read MoreAt the same time, Warhol continuously played coy about his own sexuality, sidestepping those questions. Toward that end, Rossi spends a considerable amount of time focusing on Warhol's relationships -- first with Jed Johnson, and later film executive Jon Gould.In those moments and others, the artist doesn't always serve as the most reliable of narrators, and the third-party voices enlisted to discuss him -- ranging from close associates to biographers -- often shed more light on who Warhol really was than the diary entries do.The disembodied voice that reads from the diaries proves distracting at first, eventually settling into a kind of soothing rhythm with its detached, mechanical delivery. Increasingly popular, the approach has matured but still feels like a gimmick, and hiring an actor for those purposes surely would have been just as effective. (CNN's recent Anthony Bourdain documentary, \"Roadrunner,\" employed a similar device, triggering a debate about the practice.)\"The Andy Warhol Diaries\" provides ample detail about the artist's life, beginning with his humble origins in Pittsburgh, creating his trademark image and encompassing events like his shooting in 1968 and subsequent fear of hospitals, which played a role in his death in 1987.Yet for all that the series meticulously reveals, it only goes so far in penetrating Warhol's protective shell, and like its subject, alternates between being fascinating and frustrating.Warhol was an extraordinarily public figure who endeavored to maintain a private curtain.

Set in the moneyed corridors of New York during the 1880s, Fellowes and his sprawling cast have delivered another sharp look at wealth and class in earlier times, when even those with the gold chafed against the intricate rules.The backdrop here lies not in British aristocracy but rather the hostility of old-money families toward what they dismissively refer to as \"the new people,\" those who have recently come into fortunes but lack the arrived-on-the-Mayflower claims to elite status.That intra-class warfare and the ostentatious displays of wealth associated with it are viewed in part through the wide eyes of a new arrival, Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson, the youngest of Meryl Streep's talented acting daughters), who, after the death of her father, travels from rural Pennsylvania to reside with her two aunts, the imperious Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski) and mousier Ada Brook (Cynthia Nixon).Agnes married well, allowing her sister, as she notes, \"the pure and tranquil life of a spinster.\" Like the Dowager Countess in \"Downton,\" Fellowes graces her with all the best lines, which Baranski delivers with dripping venom, her fangs barely concealed. To her constant irritation, the \"new\" people to whom she objects reside directly across the street, in the form of railroad baron George Russell (Morgan Spector) and his wife Bertha (Carrie Coon), who employ a Downton-like array of servants. When not maintaining the mansion, the downstairs folk gossip about the Russells' prospects of being accepted into high society, which is Bertha's relentless goal.Read More\"She's built a palace to entertain the sort of people who will never come here,\" sneers Bertha's maid (Kelley Curran), while plotting as to how she can escape such service.Cynthia Nixon, Christine Baranski (foreground) play sisters in 'The Gilded Age.'This American version also brings race into the mix, with Marian's trip introducing her to Peggy Scott (Den\u00e9e Benton), an aspiring Black writer who takes a position in Agnes's employ. Marian's desire to become Peggy's friend betrays both her naivete and the overt racism of the times, though with marginal depth, a perhaps inevitable function of everything else that's unfolding upstairs and downstairs.Fellowes remains an absolute master at juggling a dizzying number of subplots as well as finding intriguing wrinkles in characters with relatively small roles, such as Blake Ritson as Agnes's scheming son. There's a particular embarrassment of riches on the actress side, with Audra McDonald, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Donna Murphy to help class up the already-classy joint.The early episodes (five of the nine were previewed) also impressively chew through story, indicating that while the dresses might look stiff and confining, the pacing isn't.The casting is as impeccable as the period costumes, with Jacobson as the marginally modern newcomer caught in the middle of these old grudges, and Coon and Spector excelling as the ultimate power couple, playing a long game in leveraging their wealth to break down the barriers erected by the entrenched establishment.One of the tensions involves the question of Marian marrying for something other than financial advantage, a prospect greeting with horror by her pragmatic aunt. \"Will you concede nothing to my age and experience?\" Agnes asks her.Although real-life figures from the period pass through the story, \"The Gilded Age\" quickly carves out a dense reality all its own. And while several characters have obvious \"Downton\" counterparts (including life in the closet for gays during this era), the Yankee flavor distinguishes the series enough to stand apart from it.It's early to pronounce this fully as another \"Downton\"-like addiction, with one movie and another on the way. Yet Fellowes has laid out the foundation for a period soap with that lofty potential, in what is already a very enticing piece of \"Abbey\"-adjacent real estate.\"The Gilded Age\" premieres Jan. 24 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "2"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and \"Joe vs Carole\" feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's \"Tiger King,\" a.k.a.

Cage said at the time that the conclusion was the story had lost its relevance, which seems even truer now than it was then.Read MoreJohn Cameron Mitchell as 'Joe Exotic' in Peacock's 'Joe vs. Carole' (Mark Taylor/Peacock).The bottom line is that you never really want to try telling a story like this after one of the principals has already hit the \"Dancing With the Stars\" stage of its life cycle.That's not to say that some illuminating moments don't emerge, such as Joe dealing with homophobia in his past, before announcing when he buys the land that became his big-cat park, \"No one's gonna make me feel small again.\"As for Carole, the glimpses of her tumultuous first marriage humanize her a bit, while allowing the character to address her husband's disappearance by saying, \"I don't miss him, but I didn't kill him.\" Meanwhile, she continues to provoke the easily riled Joe, despite advice from her husband Howard (Kyle MacLachlan) that engaging with him and his ilk amounts to \"swatting at flies.\"Adapted from a Wondery podcast, \"Joe vs Carole\" might actually provide its most memorable flourish in sequences that viewers won't see, since the unfinished episodes made available for review feature dogs as stand-ins for the big cats, with a note that the lions and tigers will be added using computer-generated imagery.The dogs turn out to be very good boys and girls, patiently creating safe substitutes for the actors to play against. As for \"Joe vs Carole\" and the rest of those cool cats and kittens, while a limited series might have sounded like a swell idea back when the docuseries leapt into the zeitgeist, in March 2022, the timing is less than purr-fect.\"Joe vs Carole\" premieres March 3 on Peacock."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "27"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Once you get past the astonishing makeup and prosthetics, \"Pam & Tommy\" essentially functions as two miniseries in one, the first devoted to the central couple, and the latter to the hapless guy who turned them into a pioneering Internet sensation.

The former works better, in a limited series that sprinkles social insight (if not quite enough) in with its salacious qualities and breezy nostalgia.To get the obvious out of the way, Lily James (especially) and Sebastian Stan disappear into the roles of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, whose whirlwind romance, week-later marriage and tumultuous relationship were in essence defined by the leak of a sexually explicit tape the pair had shot of themselves.The couple was media catnip then and should be again, especially with attention-grabbing flourishes like a naked Tommy engaging in a conversation with the most famous part of himself \u2014 assisted by special effects \u2014 when he decides to give up the bachelor life and marry Pam.That fantastical sequence captures the project's whimsical and slightly uneven tone (\"I, Tonya's\" Craig Gillespie directed the first three episodes), with the story set in motion by Rogen's Rand Gauthier, a cash-strapped carpenter doing work on Lee's palatial house.When Lee fires him and stiffs him on payment, Gauthier decides to seek compensation and a measure of revenge by pilfering items from the property. Among them he finds the videotape, capitalizing upon his convenient ties to the porn industry through an unsavory producer (Nick Offerman) to try to wring every last buck out of its exposure. (In a particularly amusing moment, Gauthier rails against a guy selling bootleg copies in the Tower Records parking lot, as if there's no honor among literal thieves.)Read MoreFor Tommy, it's not that big a deal, and he emerges here as both a jerk and caricature of a crazed rock star -- brandishing guns, wearing tiny bikini underwear and indulging every whim without much impulse control. That includes following Pam to Cancun, uninvited, a day after meeting her.One challenge, in fact, is that Pam represents the only sympathetic character, yearning to be more than just a human-sized Barbie doll, citing Jane Fonda as a role model. The series' most pointed observations involve the casual misogyny directed at her, from the \"Baywatch\" producers excising her monologue \u2014 preferring that she simply run silently along the beach \u2014 to her awkward appearance on Jay Leno's \"The Tonight Show.\"She's the true victim of this invasion of privacy, in a way symbolic of the casual misogyny in the '90s that Tommy can't even begin to comprehend.And yet, after telling her friends that she's \"done with bad boys\" (despite the one shown in a flashback to her past), she instantly falls for him, with all the baggage that entails. A lot of things here might be fake, but James' performance feels real, in a manner that helps ground the whole exercise.The series also has its fun revisiting the evolution of porn, when tapes were all the rage and the notion of dialing it up on a box-shaped computer provokes quizzical stares. When a shady financial backer (played by Andrew Dice Clay) tells Gauthier and his partner, \"Nobody is ever getting rich off a celebrity sex tape,\" at that point there's little evidence to prove him wrong.Based on a 2014 Rolling Stone article, \"Pam & Tommy\" can't escape the sense that it's stretching to get through eight chapters, giving Gauthier's arc and the caper aspect more weight than they can readily carry.On balance, though, the series is still well worth watching, and not just for the parts designed to get all the attention -- namely, the ones that would warrant delivering it in a plain brown wrapper.\"Pam & Tommy\" premieres Feb. 2 on Hulu."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "21"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Best known for \"Friday Night Lights,\" producer Jason Katims has crafted another small coming-of-age gem with \"As We See It,\" adapting an Israeli series about a trio of 20-somethings on the autism spectrum, trying to find purpose and independence. ", "full_article_text": " (CNN)Best known for \"Friday Night Lights,\" producer Jason Katims has crafted another small coming-of-age gem with \"As We See It,\" adapting an Israeli series about a trio of 20-somethings on the autism spectrum, trying to find purpose and independence. Heartbreaking and touching in its central characters' vulnerability, this Amazon series deserves to be seen and celebrated.Featuring actors who are indeed on the spectrum, the show focuses on three young adults sharing an apartment, overseen by an aide, Mandy (Sosie Bacon), who deeply cares about them, while wrestling with a decision about whether to move on in pursuit of another opportunity.For the main characters, things taken for granted represent major challenges, whether that's holding down a job -- and curbing the impulse to tell your boss that you're smarter than he is, as Jack (Rick Glassman) does in the premiere episode -- or simply walking to the corner, for Harrison (Albert Rutecki) a process made terrifying by loud noises like revving motorcycles or barking dogs.Violet (Sue Ann Pien), meanwhile, is working at Arby's, where the absence of the usual filters prompts her to ask out a guy who is just ordering a sandwich.\"I'm 25, I want a boyfriend,\" she explains later. \"It's normal to have a boyfriend, I want to be normal.\"Read MoreBut \"normal\" doesn't come naturally, and there's the constant worry that others will take advantage of what open books these characters are. That's a concern for Violet's brother, Van (\"Crazy Rich Asians'\" Chris Pang), who is responsible for her with their parents gone, and Jack's dad (Joe Mantegna), whose cancer diagnosis heightens his apprehensions about not being around to look after him. \"I need to know you're going to be OK,\" he tells his son.\"As We See It\" possesses the bittersweet tone of an indie movie, unfolding in eight half-hour chapters. The performances are understated and natural, and the situations occasionally uncomfortable, with Violet learning the hard way that her work \"friends\" aren't necessarily people upon whom she can rely.The balancing act for this sort of concept hinges on making these characters seem real without condescending to them, a line that Katims and company walk with considerable sensitivity. It's worth noting that the show also follows others that have explored autism, including Netflix's \"Atypical\" (a soapier construct) and its reality-dating acquisition from Down Under \"Love on the Spectrum.\"Like the latter show, this fictional version makes dating a central point of conflict, a process made considerably more difficult for people prone to say exactly what they think, and who can start contemplating wedding invitations at the first sign of potential romantic interest.\"I'm very bad at reading signs,\" Jack confesses.That he is. But when it comes to portraying characters who, as the title suggests, see the world a little differently, \"As We See It\" is very good in all the ways that matter.\"As We See It\" premieres Jan. 21 on Amazon."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "14"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "In shows like \"Yellowstone,\" \"Kominsky Method,\" \"Young Sheldon\" and \"B-Positive,\" older actors are having a moment worth celebrating.", "full_article_text": "TV OT is a weekly look at what CNN's entertainment team is watching since too much television has us all working overtime. (CNN)The Screen Actors Guild nominations were all over the place, but on the television side, they did reveal one significant trend: The recent boon for older actors, driven heavily by, but not limited to, streaming.The nominations saw Martin Short and Steve Martin recognized for Hulu's \"Only Murders in the Building,\" Michael Douglas in the comedy running for Netflix's \"The Kominsky Method,\" and Jean Smart a triple nominee, individually for HBO Max's \"Hacks\" and HBO's \"Mare of Easttown,\" and collectively with the cast for the former.\"Yellowstone,\" a show anchored by Kevin Costner's steely presence, also broke through, as did Brian Cox as another powerful patriarch in \"Succession\" and Michael Keaton for \"Dopesick,\" the fact-based limited series about the opioid epidemic.It's no secret that Hollywood has faced accusations of ageism, seeking younger audiences at the expense of older players both in front of and behind the camera. Yet the priorities and business model of streaming, and the abundance of content that it has created, appears to be tinkering with that math.Unlike ad-supported networks that have prioritized reaching more youthful demographics, streaming relies on subscriptions, and features high-profile talent in part as a means to generate the kind of attention that will inspire people to ante up. While advertisers pay a premium to reach adults under 50, their parents and grandparents' money is just as green when handed over directly.Read MoreWhile perhaps most prevalent in streaming, this trend isn't unique to it. Chuck Lorre, the producer of hit comedies like \"The Big Bang Theory,\" its prequel \"Young Sheldon\" and the aforementioned \"Kominsky Method,\" has stocked his shows with older regulars.Hector Elizondo is among the new cast members on this season of \"B Positive.\"On \"Young Sheldon,\" that has meant supplementing the core cast beyond Annie Potts as the grandma with Craig T. Nelson, Ed Begley Jr., Reba McEntire and Wallace Shawn.\"B Positive,\" another Lorre production, has taken an even more marked turn in its second season, with a major makeover that put the lead character played by Annaleigh Ashford in charge of an assisted-living facility, adding a number of veteran performers -- H\u00e9ctor Elizondo, Jane Seymour, Ben Vereen, and Jim Beaver \u2014 as the residents.There's a practical aspect to all this, including data indicating that the streaming audience has gotten older during the pandemic. Last year, the research firm Ampere Analysis issued a report suggesting that Netflix's subscriber base has grown older as those viewers seek more entertainment options at home.The appetite for streaming content hasn't gone unnoticed by performers, especially with certain kinds of movies having witnessed their viability in theaters significantly erode -- a dynamic that preceded Covid-19 and has only become more pronounced over the last two years.In a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Sandra Bullock -- who has starred in two movies for Netflix -- referenced Hollywood's brutal history in terms of putting actresses \"out to pasture\" once they reach a certain age.\"They're good to artists. They're good to filmmakers. If it wasn't for Netflix, a lot of people wouldn't be working,\" Bullock, who is 57, said. \"Their stories wouldn't be told. Who would think that me, as a woman, would still be working at this point?\"Michael Douglas, Sarah Baker and Kathleen Turner in the third season of \"The Kominsky Method.\"Of course, Bullock is a whippersnapper relative to Rita Moreno and William Shatner, both 90, with the former featured prominently in Steven Spielberg's new version of \"West Side Story,\" and the latter making headlines by traveling into space aboard Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. (Shatner also starred in a movie released last year, \"Senior Moment,\" opposite the ubiquitous Smart.)A few caveats apply. Although there have been shows like \"Kominsky Method\" and \"Grace and Frankie,\" starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, juicier parts for actors in that age bracket -- beyond the customary wacky grandparent roles -- still generally come in multigenerational series.In addition, the recent signs of progress follow a long period in which actors -- particularly women -- saw opportunities fall off a cliff as they age out of the demo. Geena Davis, an outspoken advocate on this issue, recently discussed those challenges in a podcast interview, citing the longstanding practice of male actors insisting on casting much younger women as their romantic interests, a situation she claimed to have personally experienced.At the same time, the increasingly niche nature of entertainment has facilitated breakthroughs, even in movies. Last year's Oscars saw then-83-year-old Anthony Hopkins become the oldest best actor winner ever for \"The Father,\" with two performers in their 60s and 70s, Frances McDormand and Youn Yuh-jung, respectively, joining him in the winner's circle.In a 2019 interview, Lorre cited the storytelling potential in writing about getting old, including \"losing loved ones, endless health issues, [and] feeling estranged from the culture \u2014 which is very much a youth-dominated culture.\"Television has been and, in most respects, remains a youth-dominated medium. But thanks to these shows and others, the terms of that estrangement have begun to look at least a bit more hospitable."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "22"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Both films, now on Netflix, tell stories about children of Indian immigrants.

Along the way, Monica's relationships with her brother Sonny (Ritesh Rajan), her mother Jaya (Anna Khaja) and her best friend Krista (Lalaine) -- and those characters' own struggles -- help her figure out how to move forward.Analysis: Creators of color, your time in Hollywood is nowThe question of how to move forward is also at the center of \"Donkeyhead,\" a film from English-Canadian director Agam Darshi that is also now on Netflix. It follows Mona (played by Darshi), a failing writer in her mid-30s who is living in her childhood home in Canada with her ailing Sikh father. When he falls into a coma, Mona starts to unravel and her three siblings show up to handle things.Both films, which were recently acquired by Ava DuVernay's distribution company Array, tell stories about children of Indian immigrants (Bengali Hindus in \"Definition Please\" and Sikh Punjabis in \"Donkeyhead\"). But instead of their cultures taking center stage, the characters grapple with stagnation and subvert cultural expectations -- challenging the model minority trope in the process.They depict deeply flawed charactersIn \"Donkeyhead,\" Mona is the black sheep of the family -- the only one of her siblings who doesn't appear to have it all together. She resists religious convention, pushing back when her aunt wants to host three days of continuous Sikh prayers at the family home. Her writing career is in shambles after she failed to turn in her book draft. To top it all off, she's having an affair with a married man.Put another way, Mona is the \"donkeyhead\" of the family.The title \"Donkeyhead\" is a reference to a common Punjabi insult and term of endearment.\"Sikh Punjabis obviously really love their kids, but they can be rough. The language can be rough. And it comes through in the child-rearing,\" Darshi explained. \"[My mom] would call me donkey every time I would do something stupid. As much as it is an insult, it's also a term of endearment.\"But Mona is also the one who stayed behind to care for their father after his cancer diagnosis -- despite the abuse she experienced at his hands when she was a child. In doing so, Mona is trying to prove to her father that she's more than the \"donkeyhead\" he sees her as. But she's also reckoning with the fact that when her father dies, she might finally be forced to confront her aimless existence.They're both universal and specific\"Donkeyhead\" is at once universal and specific. It's an exploration of messy family dynamics, compassion, forgiveness and self-discovery. But it tells that story through the distinct lens of a Sikh, Punjabi immigrant family -- a demographic that has rarely been depicted with nuance and complexity on screen.In \"Donkeyhead,\" Mona and her siblings are preparing for their father's death while coming to terms with their own fears and insecurities.\"I really wanted to represent a messy, flawed South Asian woman because I don't think we have enough of that in cinema,\" Darshi said. \"And I really wanted to represent and create space for a Sikh, Punjabi man with a turban on camera in a way that we've never seen before either.\"Day had similar ambitions for \"Definition Please.\" \"What happens in Western media and Hollywood stories is they depict all Indians as the same people, whereas there's Gujaratis and Punjabis and South Indians and Bengalis,\" she said. \"Yes, we have a lot of similarities but we also eat different food, we wear different clothes, all of our weddings are different. I really wanted to tap into my culture because I love when I watch films that are very specific, yet can be universal to all people.\"One of the central tensions of \"Definition Please\" is Monica's estranged relationship with her brother Sonny -- and their mother's attempts to reunite them.\"Definition Please\" nods to Bengali soap operas, sprinkles in Bangla words and shows Monica co-sleeping with her mom. But its characters are facing very real challenges -- Monica's brother Sonny is battling bipolar disorder and the weight of always being compared to his high-achieving younger sister. His family members are coming to terms with how to understand his condition. Monica is dealing with her own issues.\"I wanted to show the beauty of that universal experience and normalize us as people, while also having the culture there as a background and not focusing the story on a character's conflict with their culture,\" Day added. They normalize not having it all figured out\"Donkeyhead\" director Agam Darshi sees her film as a kind of coming-of-age story.Ultimately, \"Definition Please\" and \"Donkeyhead\" are coming-of-age stories of sorts -- both exploring the feeling of being in a state of arrested development even after adolescence. \"I love coming-of-age stories, and I always feel like they're somewhat wasted on the young,\" Darshi said. \"I think it's so much more interesting to watch somebody who's close to 40 having to start over and having to realize that everything that they had grown up with and believed in was perhaps false -- that they have to start anew or that they've learned something and they're coming into their own.\"Against the expectations of a culture that emphasizes achievement and success from an early age, the two films normalize the experience of being an adult and not having it all figured out. They signal that it's okay to be a late bloomer, or in the words of former spelling bee champion Monica Chowdry, an opsimath.

Mei is indeed undergoing a bodily transformation -- just not the one her mom thinks. As Mei soon discovers, she poofs into a furry red panda when she's overcome with emotion, reverting back only when she gets her emotions under control. Menstruation may not be what's ailing Mei, but the metaphor for periods, puberty and the ensuing emotional roller coaster is clear.Read MoreBy normalizing -- and even celebrating -- one of life's most awkward phases, \"Turning Red\" does something not often seen on film and television, especially media aimed at kids. It treats periods and female puberty as something to be embraced, rather than be embarrassed about.'Turning Red' normalizes periodsThough periods are an experience shared by half the world's population for a significant part of their lives, they're often regarded onscreen (when they're regarded at all) with fear, shame or disgust. It's a taboo that director Domee Shi was acutely aware of.\"You don't see that very often in movies and TV shows,\" Shi said in an interview with entertainment news site Uproxx, of the period talk between Mei and her mom. \"And I think that's precisely why we wanted to put it in the movie. I mean, this movie is actually is for 13-year-old Domee that was in a bathroom, horrified, thinking that she had crapped her pants. And too afraid to tell her mom or ask anybody about what was going on.\"Mei's complicated relationship with her mother is at the heart of \"Turning Red.\"While positive period portrayals in kids' and family-oriented movies and TV shows are rare, there are some notable examples. In a 1990 episode of \"The Cosby Show,\" in which Rudy gets her first period, the youngest Huxtable rebuffs her mom Clair Huxtable's efforts to celebrate the occasion and turns to her friends for support. When the information she gets from her pals is faulty, it's Clair who steps in to reassure her that periods are completely normal.There was the 1991 episode of the sitcom \"Blossom,\" which saw its titular character struggling to talk to her dad about her first period and wishing she had Clair Huxtable to guide her. A scene from the 1991 coming-of-age film \"My Girl\" features Vada screaming that she's hemorrhaging, only to be told that she's gotten her period. A 2001 episode of the animated series \"Braceface\" sees Sharon mistake her menstrual cramps for appendicitis. And in more recent history, the ABC sitcom \"Black-ish\" treats Diane's first period as an empowering experience.Still, these examples tend to be the exception, not the norm. Tackling the subject of periods feels especially radical for an animation giant like Pixar, given that 20 of the 24 films released by the studio center males. But by addressing menstruation with candor and levity, the creators of \"Turning Red\" intend to destigmatize it -- for everyone, not just young girls.\"The hope is with putting it on the screen and having it be something that is cringy, but also funny, and a part of this story, it does normalize it,\" producer Lindsey Collins told pop culture and gaming news site Polygon. \"There's an appreciation from anybody who's gone through it for what we put on the screen, but also those who haven't gone through it.\"It also embraces the emotional extremes of pubertyBeyond periods, \"Turning Red\" explores puberty in all its uncomfortable glory -- through the eyes of a confident, goofy Chinese Canadian girl. In the words of Shi, it's an \"Asian tween fever dream.\"Throughout the film, Mei navigates the awkwardness, excitement and embarrassment that come with changing hormone levels and manifest in her body as a red panda. She grapples with lust and attraction, crushing on the teenage convenience store cashier and members of her favorite boy band 4*Town alike. She imagines her objects of desire as mermen, then berates herself for doing so when her drawings are found out. She longs to see 4*Town in concert with her best friends, and vents to them angrily when her mom says no.\"From the very beginning, [I was] just really trying to not hold back with telling the story about a girl going through puberty. We're going to go there,\" Shi said in an interview with IndieWire. \"From the very first version, it had pads, it had puberty, it had the weird boy crushes and drawings.\"Mei is just like any other girl navigating puberty -- except for the turning into a panda part.But perhaps the most profound challenge for Mei during this period of her life is figuring out how to be herself while also respecting the wishes of her parents -- a coming-of-age dilemma surely familiar to many children of immigrants. As Mei discovers more about who she is, she finds that parts of herself conflict with the image her mother has of her. Learning to accept those parts of herself, while finding the courage to stand up to her mother, is part of Mei's pubescent transformation, too.Shi has said she hopes that \"Turning Red\" helps girls and women feel seen -- and that it signals that periods, puberty and unwieldy emotions are simply a normal part of life."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "11", "day": "8"}, "text": {"headline": "us", "text": "For more than three decades, viewers came to know Alex Trebek as the face of the hit TV game show \"Jeopardy!\" But lesser known was his charitable work and all the time and money he gave to a number of causes, from health care to hairy creatures.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)For more than three decades, viewers came to know Alex Trebek as the face of the hit TV game show \"Jeopardy!\" But what was lesser-known about Trebek was his charitable work.

(\"The Last Jedi\" was the highest-grossing movie in the United States last year and raked in nearly $1.3 billion worldwide.) \"It is very much a movie of this time,\" said the Rev. angel Kyodo williams, a Buddhist teacher, social justice activist and \"Star Wars\" aficionado who lives Berkeley, California. \"It draws on ancient teachings, as well as what is happening in this country right now.\"Read MoreBut there's some debate about what \"The Last Jedi\" intends to say about modern religious life: Is it warning about the end of organized religion, or a parable about spiritual renewal? 'Do, or do not. There is no try.' \"Star Wars\" is, at heart, a story about the rise and fall of an ancient religion. When we meet the Jedis, in Episode I, they're mindfulness-meditating, axiom-spouting space monks who keep order in the galaxy and swing a swift lightsaber. By Episode VIII -- \"The Last Jedi\" -- the once-great order is reduced to a lone soul, Luke Skywalker, serving a self-imposed penance on a remote island. When Rey, the young heroine, shows up seeking spiritual training, Luke refuses. The Jedi religion is over, he says, a victim of its own hypocrisy and hubris. Luke even prepares to burn the ancient Jedi texts. (In a bit of historical irony, the island on which the scene is filmed, Skellig Michael, was home to medieval Irish monks who \"saved civilization\" by rescuing ancient Christian books.)  But the film hints that Luke might not be the \"last Jedi,\" after all. Even without his help, Rey is remarkably skilled at connecting with the Force, the mysterious energy that pervades the galaxy. This is where some cultural commentators see an argument against organized religion. In previous \"Star Wars\" films, using the Force required joining the Jedis and spending years learning the \"old ways\" from established masters. Luke seems to say that none of that matters anymore. \"He is making a very modern case for spirituality over organized religion,\" argues Hannah Long in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. \"If all roads lead to the Force, then the dusty tradition and doctrine doesn't really matter.\"In The Atlantic, Chaim Saiman makes a similar argument. \"The Last Jedi\" seems to reflect many millennials' ideas about religion, namely their waning interest in \"structured religion\" in favor of \"unbounded spirituality,\" he writes.  But is that the whole story? 'Always two there are: A master and apprentice' George Lucas, the creator of \"Star Wars,\" says he wanted to do more than entertain the masses. He wanted to introduce young Americans to spiritual teachings though \"new myths\" for our globalized, pluralistic millennium.\"I see 'Star Wars' as taking all the issues that religion represents and trying to distill them down into a more modern and accessible construct,\" Lucas has said. \"I wanted to make it so that young people would begin to ask questions about the mystery.\"Overthinking the initiation into 'Star Wars' for our kidsIn this, Lucas sounds a lot like his mentor, Joseph Campbell, a scholar who studied world myths. Campbell argued that all cultures impart their values to the next generation through archetypal stories. He believed the same about organized religion, but said it must \"catch up\" to the \"moral necessities of the here and now.\"  Lucas himself has been called a \"Buddhist/Methodist,\" though it's not clear that he identifies with either religious tradition. \"Let's say I'm spiritual,\" he told Time magazine in 1999.Irvin Kirshner, the director of the \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" says Yoda -- the small but spiritually powerful Jedi master -- was created in part to evangelize for Buddhism. \"I want to introduce some Zen here,\" he said, \"because I don't want the kids to walk away just thinking that everything is a shoot-'em-up.\"Mushim Patricia Ikeda, a Buddhist teacher and social justice activist, said Yoda reminds her of the monks she studied with in Korea: wise, cryptic and a little impish. \"I watched those movies and I thought, check, check, double-check,\" said Ikeda, the community coordinator at the East Bay Meditation Center in Oakland, California.  There's been a lot written about Buddhism in \"Star Wars,\" from scholarly papers to popular books, so I won't go into too much detail here. Suffice it to say, \"Star Wars\" borrows quite a bit from Buddhist  symbols, teachings and practices. One writer calls it \"Zen with lightsabers.\"The name of the Jedi Order itself could be borrowed from Asian culture, said religion scholar Christian Feichtinger. The \"jidaigeki,\" a genre of popular movies in Japan, depict samurai learning to combine swordsmanship with spiritual training, and slowly discovering that the mind is mightier than the sword. (Sound familiar?) Throughout \"Star Wars,\" the Jedi talk often about mindfulness and concentration, attachment and interdependence, all key Buddhist ideas. Two -- mindfulness and concentration -- are steps on the Eightfold Path, the Buddha's guide to spiritual liberation. You could argue that \"The Last Jedi,\" telegraphs its spiritual debts to Buddhism. When Rey is meditating, she touches the ground, mirroring an iconic image of the \"earth-touching\" Buddha.And, as an astute colleague noticed, a mosaic pool a Jedi temple shows an icon that looks a lot like Kannon Boddhisattva, a large-eared Buddhist being who hears the cries of the world.  But there's more to spirituality in \"Star Wars\" than Buddhism. Like Zen itself, the saga blends aspects of Taoism and other religious traditions. \"The Force,\" for example, sounds a lot like the Taoist idea of \"chi,\" the subtle stream of energy that animates the world. There's plenty about \"Star Wars\" that doesn't jibe with Buddhism, not least the fact that Darth Vader -- the supreme personification of evil -- is an avid meditator. Even the storylines that borrow from other religions teach Buddhist lessons. Take Darth Vader's narrative. He was born of a virgin, and was supposed to save the galaxy before he succumbed to temptation, all ideas with clear Christian resonances. But the reason for Vader's fall from grace -- the lessons viewers are supposed to take away -- seems distinctly Buddhish. Anakin Skywalker, the Jedi who will become Darth Vader, had been \"attached\" to the idea of saving his family, Yoda says.\"Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.\" 'Clear, your mind must be'Earlier this month, the East Bay Meditation Center in Oakland, California, hosted a workshop called \"Jedi Insights: A Force For Justice.\" About 40 people turned out, including several teenagers and new meditators.John Ellis and Mushim Patricia Ikeda with students at a workshop based on \"Star Wars\" at the East Bay Meditation Center. Ikeda, who co-led the workshop, said many teens are like Rey, the inexperienced but enthusiastic Jedi:  looking for mentors to help unravel the mystery of self-knowledge. \"They're like, please, please, please, give me that spiritual training,\" Ikeda said. During the workshop, Ikeda and her co-teacher, John Ellis, discussed \"Star Wars\" scenes and led guided meditations. Inevitably, a few lively lightsaber battles broke out. Almost as inevitably, because this is America in 2018, the discussion got political.  \"There's so much going on, from the environment to taxes to education, that it's easy to be overwhelmed,\" Ellis said. \"'Star Wars' help us think about how meditation teaches us to focus on the task at hand, and bring our best self to it.\" 'A pile of old books' So what is the spiritual message in \"The Last Jedi,\" and what -- if anything -- can it tell us about religion in real life?It's true that millennials may be eager for spiritual training, but they are are increasingly unlikely to identify with a specific religion. Nearly one in three says they have no religious affiliation. But let's take a closer look at why millennials are leaving, or forsaking, the fold. A new study of young former Catholics, conducted by St. Mary's Press Catholic Research Group and Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, found that more blamed their family for the decision to leave the church than the church institution itself. Only 11% said they quit Catholicism because they oppose the church or religious institutions in general.The study also found that nearly half had joined other religious communities, including other Christian ones. So is organized religion really the issue here? It's no secret that we're living during a time of seismic shifts, from technology to politics to spirituality. It's not so much an \"era of changes,\" Pope Francis has said, as a \"change of eras.\" So what's the leader of a 2,000-year-old church to do?The answer is not resurrecting \"obsolete practices and forms,\" Francis says. Some Catholic customs, while beautiful, \"no longer serve as means of communicating the Gospel.\" But the Pope is no iconoclast, eager to discard sacred traditions. In fact, he wants Catholics to go back to the roots of their religion, the Gospel. Francis has repeatedly implored Christians, particularly priests, to put Jesus' words into action by caring for the sick, the lame and the poor. He wants shepherds who smell like their sheep, not bookkeepers who smell like sheepskin. Which brings us back to the spiritual message encoded in \"The Last Jedi.\" As Luke prepares to torch the tree containing the sacred Jedi texts, Yoda appears out of nowhere and does the deed himself, cackling all the while.  \"Time it is,\" Yoda says, \"for you to look past a pile of old books.\" Some fans were aghast that Yoda would feign sacrilege against the Jedi tradition. But when you look at the scene from a Buddhist lens, the meaning shifts. Zen is full of stories about ancient masters trying to jolt their apprentices from mental ruts. In one ancient monastery, the students paid too much attention to Buddhist images, so the head monk torched them. (\"If you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha,\" says a famous koan.) These lessons and koans are not meant to be permanent prescriptions for all Buddhists for all time. They're highly particular, transmitted from master to apprentice, one mind to another. In that light, maybe Yoda's apparent willingness to burn the \"old pile of books\" isn't really about texts, which he already knows are safely in Rey's possession. Maybe it isn't even about religion. It's just about Luke. Yoda is trying to shock him out of his guilt and shame about the past, and make him focus on \"the need in front of (his) nose,\" the Resistance that could sorely use a little saving.   So perhaps the real spiritual message of \"Star Wars\" isn't about the end or beginning of organized religion. Maybe, like a good Zen teacher, it's a mirror showing us our own minds. Are we preoccupied with the past, concerned about the future, or paying attention to the needs in front of our noses?"}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2019", "month": "5", "day": "23"}, "text": {"headline": "media", "text": "With Galaxy's Edge \u2014 Disneyland's new Star Wars land opening in Anaheim, California next week \u2014 Disney shows off one of its core corporate strengths. Here's how its theme parks could keep the Star Wars magic alive long after the Skywalker saga ends.", "full_article_text": " \n\n\nDisney Imagineer Scott Trowbridge and I are sitting next to the Millennium Falcon. The ship is scarred with blast marks and rust; by all indications it's the same ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. You know: a piece of junk.Of course, we're not in a galaxy far, far away, we're in Anaheim, California, and the behemoth near us isn't a real spaceship. But starting Friday, when Disney's new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opens to the public, Trowbridge \u2014 the creative force behind the land \u2014 wants guests to forget about that for a while. \n\n\n\n\"We want the place to feel deep, so that your relationship with it can also have that kind of depth,\" Trowbridge says, motioning around what Disney calls the Black Spire Outpost \u2014 a bustling trading port on the planet Batuu. Trowbridge is speaking as if everything around him is, in fact, real. He's doing this not just because Disney's parks run on the belief in Disney magic, but because all of it must feel real in order to sell this new land to millions of Star Wars fans (a finicky bunch) and Disney park-goers (even finickier).That's especially important now. This December, the Skywalker era of Star Wars will be over. Disney is now trying to prove that the franchise is much more than just the family drama of Luke, Leia and descendents like Kylo Ren. It's betting that Galaxy's Edge will help do that.Disney calls the land the company's largest expansion at its parks ever. Its Imagineers are using innovative technology and spare-no-expense design to wrap guests into an experience. There will be a ride that allows guests to fly the Millennium Falcon, shops that allow them to build their own lightsabers, and restaurants that will serve galactic fare like fried Endorian tip-yip \u2014 or, as we like to call it, chicken.Guests at Galaxy's Edge will be able to pilot the Millennium Falcon on a ride called Smuggler's Run.Read MoreFor Disney, Galaxy's Edge represents an investment in the future, but it's also a reflection of something that has been one of the company's core strengths since it was envisioned by Walt Disney himself.For most of its history, Disney's success as a media powerhouse has relied on what company executives and MBA professors have long referred to as \"synergies\" \u2014 complementary businesses that don't just thrive on their own, but also all work in service of one another. Other companies have of course adopted similar strategies and used their various subsidiaries in this way. But Disney has practically made it into an art form. Take Marvel, which Disney has owned since 2009. First Marvel makes a comic book series, which creates characters and stories and develops a fanbase for them. Then Disney makes a movie out of those comics. The stars of that movie go on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" the main late night show on ABC, which Disney also owns, to talk about it. Then, having proved that Marvel characters can thrive on the screen, Disney makes Marvel TV shows and sells them to rivals like Netflix. Later it makes a new movie, and uses \"Monday Night Football,\" the biggest show on ESPN, which Disney also owns, to unveil a trailer. Then Disney decides to start a Netflix competitor, and it uses new Marvel shows as well as those old Marvel movies (which it ensures people won't be able to see elsewhere) as a draw. All the while, it's running special cruises on its cruise line featuring characters from the Marvel movies, creating whole new theme lands dedicated to Marvel \u2014 and, of course, making new comics and toys that reference the movies.The theme parks are one of the most important gears in Disney's synergy machine. It's the same basic idea: create or repurpose a story people love, build a deeper connection through an attraction, sell merchandise that lets them take the experience home, maybe create a blockbuster film franchise out of one of the rides, make a ton of cash, repeat. The Skywalker saga, which started with Luke, Leia and Han in 1977, ends in December.With Galaxy's Edge, Disney can move further toward realizing the full potential of the $4 billion it spent in 2012 to acquire Lucasfilm, which owns Star Wars and Indiana Jones. And it can \u2014 it hopes \u2014 future-proof Star Wars even as the Skywalkers' family drama comes to an end. If it works, that strategy will bring generations of new fans in to Star Wars, helping the company compete against Netflix and other rivals in a splintered and hypercompetitive media landscape. It's not just about synergies, though. For a long time, Disney's media networks division, including ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel, has been the company's biggest money maker, but it has come under pressure in recent years. Disney may one day soon need the theme parks to pick up some of the slack.Of course, for that to happen, they'll also need fans to embrace a Star Wars story that doesn't include the Skywalkers.     'Everything has to feel real'In building Galaxy's Edge, Disney reportedly spent $1 billion to fill up 14 acres inside Disneyland with state-of the-art rides, food and merchandise that can be personalized. (A second location, in Disney World, opens at the end of August.) Guests can quench their thirst with blue milk, one of Luke Skywalker's drinks of choice, and visit Oga's Cantina \u2014 the first bar in Disneyland other than the private Club 33 to serve alcohol. Custom bottles of Coca-Cola, served in the land, will look like little droids and feature labels written in Aurebesh \u2014 a fictional language used in the film franchise.\"For those guests who want to play Star Wars with us, we have ways,\" Trowbridge said. That deeper personalization will be made possible by technology including the Play Disney Parks app, which guests can download on their smartphones, and the resort's all-in-one bracelet, MagicBand. Oga's Cantina is the first bar to serve alcohol at Disneyland outside the private Club 33.When guests pilot the Millennium Falcon, which they'll do on the ride Smuggler's Run, their choices will impact their experiences in the rest of Galaxy's Edge. For example, if a guest loses cargo on the ride, Trowbridge said, the bartender at Oga's Cantina might issue a warning: \"I'd watch out if I were you, because I think your name's on the list of the local bounty hunter.\" Smuggler's Run will also use real-time video rendering technology created by legendary visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, a branch of Lucasfilm. That technology will react to how the guests use the ride's 200 cockpit controls.Think of it this way: You could have gone to Disneyland and ridden Peter Pan's Flight any number of times over the past 64 years \u2014 but you could never be Peter Pan. At Galaxy's Edge, Disney wants you to feel like Han Solo.And that's only one of the land's most innovative rides. Guests will be able to build their own personal droids.Rise of the Resistance, which will open later this year, is what Trowbridge calls the \"biggest attraction we've ever built.\" Disney hasn't revealed much about the ride, but we do know it will have multiple ride systems, full-sized AT-AT Walkers and even a John Williams score. Disney CEO Bob Iger calls the ride \"the most technologically advanced and immersive attraction that we have ever imagined.\" \"We're pushing the limits of imagination and innovation,\" he said at Disney's annual shareholder meeting in March. \"We'll actually blur the lines for our guests between fantasy and reality and put them right in the middle of the rebellion and give them an active role in a fight against the First Order.\" For some guests in the future, the experience will be so encompassing that they won't even leave the Star Wars galaxy to sleep. Disney is planning a full-service Star Wars-themed hotel, which will one day open near Disney World's Hollywood Studios and will have characters and storylines as well as a starship design.\"Everything has to feel real,\" Trowbridge said. \"We want there to be stuff for you to surprise you, to make you feel like you've actually walked into this universe of Star Wars.\"First Order Stormtroopers signal that Galaxy's Edge takes place during the current film trilogy.     From Sleeping Beauty's Castle to the Millennium FalconDisney could've just created a Millennium Falcon ride and lines likely would have been hours long. Instead, the company created an entire world with different locales and characters. Rather than touring familiar places like Tatooine or Cloud City, guests will find themselves in Batuu. Instead of Harrison Ford's Han Solo, they'll find an animatronic version of Hondo Ohnaka, a pirate introduced in the \"Star Wars Rebels\" animated series, signing park-goers up for Smuggler's Run. \"There's a risk that people will get in there and go, 'Hey, where is Luke Skywalker? Where's Darth Vader? I want to see that,\" said Robert Niles, editor of ThemeParkInsider.com. \"If people come away disappointed because they're not just reflecting an old experience then that could create a bit of a chilling effect on trying to expand the franchise.\"So why not just create a land full of characters and hot spots that fans already know and love?Walt Disney points to sketches of Sleeping Beauty's Castle in 1955, four years before the company released the animated film. Well, it's actually a smart move by Disney to expand the series beyond the family drama of the Skywalkers. Visitors build a stronger connection to the brand when they are front and center as opposed to an observer in this Star Wars universe, Niles said.\"Now, if a Star Wars show comes on Disney+ and the characters say, 'we're going to Black Spire Outpost,' consumers may say, 'Hey, wait a minute, I've been there before,\" he said. \"Disney wants to be directly relevant to every consumer, every day.\"Disney not only wants to boost its theme park revenue, Niles said, but also the company wants Galaxy's Edge to have an effect on other ancillary parts of the company.\"It's all about, at its heart, Disney positioning itself as a lifestyle brand,\" he said. \"It is part of your lifestyle so much so that you incorporate Disney in pretty much everything you do, from making Mickey Mouse waffles in the morning to watching Disney+ at night.\"This general idea is nothing new for Disney. The company's theme parks have long been one of the strongest extensions of Disney's corporate universe, showcasing its existing intellectual property and serving as a breeding ground for new storylines and characters.In some cases, the theme parks market films and other content. For example, Adventureland, one of Disneyland's original themed lands, was based on Disney's award-winning nature film series, \"True-Life Adventures.\" Walt Disney himself named Disneyland's focal point \"Sleeping Beauty's Castle\" in 1955, four years before the company was due to release the animated feature \"Sleeping Beauty.\" In other cases, the complementary relationship has worked the other way, with the theme parks feeding content to Disney's vast array of other businesses. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" started as a ride in 1967. More than 35 years later, it spawned a $4.5 billion film franchise that then influenced new rides around the world. Disney has also tried this model with \"The Haunted Mansion\" and will attempt it again next year with \"Jungle Cruise,\" a film starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.    \n\nA 1957 map outlining Disney's synergies at the time. Disney\n\n\nDisney's slate of upcoming films also corresponds with two of its major parks projects, Galaxy's Edge and Pandora \u2014 The World of Avatar, which opened in 2017. The company announced earlier this month that it would alternate releases of new \"Star Wars\" and \"Avatar\" films each December between 2021 and 2027.Galaxy's Edge is also a major investment in the future of Disney's parks division at a time when that division looks more important to the future of the whole company. Profits in Disney's media networks hit a high in 2015, but have since declined 15%, likely due to cord-cutting and rising programming costs, neither of which promise to improve soon. In that same period, profits for Disney's parks and resorts have gone up 47%.It's no wonder, then, why Disney is investing so heavily in the parks, even beyond the Galaxy's Edge expansion. It's adding new attractions to Epcot including a \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" roller coaster and a ride based on \"Ratatouille,\" building new Marvel-themed areas at Disney's California Adventure, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland and a \"Zootopia\"-themed land in Shanghai's Disneyland Park.     \"This has become one of our most profitable businesses as we've expanded around the world. And that has justified greater investment,\" Iger said in an interview with CNN Business' Christine Romans.As its theme parks become more important to its bottom line, Disney also needs to invest in them in order to keep its competitors in that space at bay. Comcast's Universal Studios shook up the theme park industry in 2010 with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an interactive land set in the story of Harry Potter. \"I think Wizarding World encouraged Disney to be as aggressive as they are being with Galaxy's Edge,\" Niles said. \"Disney doesn't want anyone to say, 'Oh, Universal's the creative leader in this industry because Harry Potter was so good.'\"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter allowed guests to purchase magic wands for use in the park, drink Butterbeer, the frothy butterscotch-flavored beverage from the series, and ride the Hogwarts Express train. It was a gamechanger in the theme park industry, and Disney didn't want to be outdone, Niles said.     \"With Harry Potter it no longer became acceptable for a top-level attraction just to be a standalone ride in this kind of mildly decorated area. You had to create an experience that brought you into a world from the moment you stepped foot into it,\" he said. \"So Disney had to create something that was not just their most immersive thing, but the most immersive thing.\" Trip Miller, a Disney shareholder and managing partner at hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, describes theme parks as the \"Rock of Gibraltar\" for Disney \u2014 safer and more stable than the media side of the business. \"The media side is just so rapidly changing, so whether Galaxy's Edge turns out really well for them or it's just kind of a mediocre capex spend, I think there's very little risk,\" he said.     May the Force be with you... AlwaysWe already know what Star Wars is capable of. The space saga has made more than $9 billion at the global box office since 1977. Accounting for inflation, five of the top twenty highest-grossing films in North American box office history are Star Wars movies. The original \"Star Wars\" alone made more than $1.6 billion domestically \u2014 second only to \"Gone with the Wind\" in the United States after inflation.Those numbers don't include the costs to produce and market the films, but they also don't account for all the other ways Disney has already made money off the universe, like TV shows, licensing, home video sales and merchandise. When \"Force Awakens\" hit theaters in 2015, analysts estimated that the merchandise tied to the film could generate $5 billion in sales within a year. Jeff Bock, a senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations, wouldn't take a guess at how much the brand is now worth to Disney, but said the company \"wouldn't sell 'Star Wars' for $25 billion at this point.\"Of course, because it's Disney, there are several other major Star Wars projects in the works beyond Galaxy's Edge. There are new films coming from \"Game of Thrones\" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. And there's a new live-action series: \"The Mandalorian,\" which follows a Boba Fett-esque bounty hunter. \"The Mandalorian\" will air on the company's upcoming streaming service, Disney+ \u2014 part of its strategy to use its huge library of beloved content, characters and worlds to draw users to Disney+ and away from competitors like Netflix.\n\n\n\nBut the franchise is now at an inflection point. Disney would very much like Star Wars to live on past the nine movies that George Lucas envisioned and the family he created. Galaxy's Edge is a physical manifestation of that hope and its strategy, said Suzanne Scott, an assistant professor at the University of Texas' Moody College of Communication.\"If Galaxy's Edge had been set on Tatooine, fans would have enjoyed scrutinizing every detail against its cinematic counterpart,\" she said. \"In creating Black Spire Outpost, they get all the appeal and familiarity of a spaceport/border planet, plus all of the creative freedom.\"That creative freedom allows Disney and Trowbridge to do more than just create a new world for Star War fans to enjoy \u2014 the land also presents a stepping off point for all kinds of new Star Wars experiences, memories, stories and, of course, profits too. \"We have so many stories we want to tell,\" Trowbridge told me as we sat looking around Galaxy's Edge. \"That's one of the great things about Star Wars. There will never be an end to the number of Star Wars stories that we can tell.\"Art Direction: Allie SchmitzEditors: Annalyn Kurtz and An PhungPhoto Editors: Brett Roegiers and Natalie Yubas"}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "23"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "The recent Muppet resurgence has been powered by our need for comfort and a hefty dose of positivity.

", "full_article_text": " (CNN)When Joshua Gillespie was holed up in the hospital as a kid, where he stayed frequently in between surgeries for his rare heart condition, his best friend was a 3-and-a-half-year-old monster with red fur and a vibrant imagination. Elmo, that lovable, occasionally grating Muppet and \"Sesame Street\" stalwart since 1984, kept Gillespie company for much of his early childhood from a TV inside his hospital room. He'd watch the same tapes -- the \"Best of Elmo\" compilation, usually -- so often that his nurses had chosen their own favorite parts. Gillespie has loved the Muppets ever since he watched in awe as Elmo tap danced down a staircase like a regular Fred Astaire. So seeing the preschool-aged monster get his due among other adults who grew up with him -- this time for his feud with a rock -- has been extremely gratifying, he said.\"There's so much attention being brought to these things, which is fantastic for me just to see ... there's a whole new generation of people to grow up with it,\" he said. The cast of \"Sesame Street\" celebrated the show's 50th anniversary in 2019.The Muppets have been in our lives for more than 50 years, and they're still finding new ways to entertain us, even if it's by accident (the Elmo v. Rocco feud had been going on for years on \"Sesame Street,\" but Twitter and TikTok rediscovered it earlier this month). There's a revival of \"Fraggle Rock\" debuting this month, too, and Kermit, Fozzie and the gang have been riding the nostalgia wave to potentially host the Oscars -- fans are campaigning hard for them. (New episodes of \"Sesame Street\" currently stream on HBO Max, which, like CNN, is a part of WarnerMedia.)Sesame Street introduces family with two gay dads during Pride MonthRead MoreThe recent Muppet resurgence, Gillespie suspects, has been powered by our need for comfort and a hefty dose of positivity. Adults find their way back to the Muppets when they need their favorite frog or pig or monster most. Our cherished childhood moments are preserved in internet amber, and they're often even lovelier, wittier or wilder than we remember. And their philosophy -- that the show must go on, even when sets collapse and chicken feathers fly -- is particularly poignant in years when it feels like we're perpetually jumping through our own rings of fire while a choir of chickens cluck the \"William Tell Overture.\"Things so often go south for the Muppets. But they still, always, manage to make something enduring and silly and subtly moving. They taught us our ABCs, about love and the power of a well-timed flying fish. And they're teaching us, still, about making it through the tough times and coming out stronger -- and zanier, too. The Muppets aren't just for kidsPart of why it's so easy to return to the Muppets' oeuvre is because it still holds up -- and oftentimes, it evolves with its audience. The characters are deceptively witty, often telling jokes that fly right over the heads of younger viewers like Gonzo's beloved chicken Camilla, to be uncovered on repeat viewings. Joe Hennes, who co-leads the popular Muppet fan publication ToughPigs, has devoted much of his life to harnessing that Muppet-induced joy. His lifelong love of Jim Henson's creations has helped him find a family of likeminded fans and even landed him working for several years at Sesame Workshop, where he watched -- and sometimes contributed -- to the creation of his favorite childhood series.\"There's definitely something comforting about all of those different franchises we have loved at one point in our life, so going back to them, we get to rediscover that love, which is a beautiful thing,\" he told CNN. \"You can rediscover it at different points in your life and find new joy in it.\" Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy presented at the 2012 Oscars to great fanfare.Take Hennes -- as a kid, he fell hard for the rascally Ernie and naive Big Bird. But as he's gotten older, he better appreciates the curmudgeons of the Muppet world, like Ernie's stickler foil Bert, the dreadfully serious Sam the Eagle and eternal grouch Oscar. As he's grown up with the Muppets, he's found new wrinkles in their lore to explore on ToughPigs -- and new characters to identify with. Jennifer Garlen and Anissa Graham, academics who have edited and authored collections of essays analyzing various Muppet projects, said that part of what makes Kermit, Miss Piggy and co. so enchanting is their ability to speak to viewers young and old and affect them in different ways. 'Sesame Street' introducing new Korean American character \"Jim Henson always had his eye on narratives that could speak to people of all ages, not just children, and he never saw puppetry as merely children's entertainment,\" Garlen said in an email to CNN. \"There are levels of social commentary, comedy, metaphysics, drama, and psychology in these stories that make them speak to a very broad audience; you'll also see different things if you revisit them over many years.\"Graham, a senior lecturer in English at the University of North Alabama, said that as a kid, she picked up that the Muppets were speaking to both children and their parents and felt that style bridged a divide.\"It meant that somewhere along the line those two halves could connect,\" she told CNN in an email. That's why it's so easy to fall back in love with the Muppets after some time apart: Graham said Henson's works \"remind the grown-up audiences of the value of play and nonsense not as a by-product of nostalgia but as a part of their everyday lives.\" If we can adopt the Muppets' zany, whimsical streak ourselves, we might be better for it. Nostalgia reels us back inIf there's a Muppet moment that's gone viral on your Twitter timeline in the last few years, chances are it resurfaced because of Gillespie. He runs Muppet History, accounts across social media platforms that share rare Muppets footage -- Kermit's reference-laden performance of the Talking Heads' \"Once in a Lifetime,\" anyone? -- and behind-the-scenes factoids on his favorite felt performers and their human creators. He collects moments with collaborators at ToughPigs, Muppet Wiki and friends who got lucky on eBay and uncovered reels with old Muppet clips.Nonbinary characters like 'Gonzo-rella' are lighting up children's TV and encouraging self-acceptance\"I just think the Muppets are something so timeless,\" Gillespie said. \"And I think the reason why is they've never tried to be timely. They've always been sort of irreverent.\"The Muppets may not be the timeliest comedians, but they've always got something to say. The critically acclaimed \"Fraggle Rock\" revival that debuts on Apple TV+ this month has an environmentalist bent. Big Bird, who is canonically 6 years old, received his vaccine as soon as kids his age were eligible. Last year, \"Sesame Street\" debuted its \"ABCs of Racial Literacy\" program, in which two Black Muppets discuss race and inclusion with Elmo (that's in keeping with the origins of \"Sesame Street,\" which was created with young Black viewers in mind). \"Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock\" continues the original series' environmental spirit.The Muppets' progressivism can offend the occasional viewer, but it's part of their staying power, too. While some bits haven't aged well (a few episodes of \"The Muppet Show\" on Disney+ have a content warning), characters have rarely shied from difficult conversations about death, racism, health, homelessness and other topics kids wonder about but don't always have the words to dictate. As animated as the Muppets can be, they're also mirrors for viewers to better understand themselves. Frankie Cordero, a puppeteer who plays Rudy on \"Sesame Street\" and Purple Panda on the PBS series \"Donkey Hodie,\" said he related to Gonzo, an oddball whose origins are probed in the film \"Muppets from Space.\" As a person of mixed Puerto Rican, Mexican and Spanish heritage, he often felt othered by his young peers, much like Gonzo is (though the Muppet finds a family with Kermit and the gang).\"This was an incredibly diverse group that would work to stick together as a team to defeat huge obstacles in their world,\" Cordero said. The jokes grabbed his attention as a kid, but it's the characterization that kept him as a fan -- and helped him determine that he wanted to make a career in puppetry. Henson's characters are good at evolving to stay relevant, but they're still themselves, forever the ages they were when they debuted. Cookie Monster will forever hunger for his favorite dessert, just like the Count will forever obsess over numbers, and Kermit will forever flail his gangly green arms when he's excited, peeved or overwhelmed. \"The Muppets are always going to be the Muppets,\" Hennes said. \"They'll always have that opportunity to surprise us with something new or bring back that feeling of joy.\"The Muppets teach us how to keep goingThere's an appropriate metaphor for the last two years of destruction and disorder in the finale of \"The Muppet Movie.\" The final minutes see Kermit and his newfound family of weirdos finally making the film of their dreams. The cast breaks into a reprise of \"Rainbow Connection,\" and just when things seem stable, if a bit stale, the set comes crashing down. Things explode, Gonzo's hanging onto a balloon for dear life, and then, just when all seems lost, a real rainbow finds its way through a gaping hole in the studio roof. The Muppets bask in its glow while the pieces of their would-be film lay strewn around them. \"Life's like a movie -- write your own ending,\" Kermit sings. \"Keep believing, keep pretending, we've done just what we've set out to do.\" Elmo is always 3, but he's evolved with his viewers. The Muppets cobbled together a film out of debris and chaos -- one could say they thrive on chaos (that's kind of Animal's whole M.O.), or have at least found a way to work through it. Revisiting their funniest pratfalls or most touching musical numbers through older, hardened eyes returns to us \"a bit of hope,\" Gillespie said. Elmo was Gillespie's constant companion while he recovered from heart surgeries. Now, Elmo's a hero among Gillespie's peers once again for standing up against a pet rock who took the last oatmeal raisin cookie. And the cycle continues.\"Right now we need that comfort ... that things are gonna be okay, because, well, Kermit the Frog says it's gonna be okay, I think it's gonna be okay then,\" he said. \"I think it's gonna be all right.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "2", "day": "4"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "In a rare public rebuke,Kim Kardashian has pushed back on estranged husband Kanye West's posting about their daughter North being on TikTok.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)In a rare public rebuke,Kim Kardashian has pushed back on estranged husband Kanye West's posting about their daughter North being on TikTok.On Friday the rap mogul, who now goes by \"Ye,\" posted a screen grab on his verified Instagram account of their eight-year-old on TikTok.\"Since this is my first divorce I need to know what I should do about my daughter being put on TikTok against my will,\" the caption read.Kardashian shot back with a statement, posted on the stories portion of her verified Instagram account, in which she wrote, \"Kanye's constant attacks on me in interviews and on social media is actually more hurtful than any TikTok North might create.\"\"As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children, I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity in the medium that she wishes with adult supervision -- because it brings her so much happiness,\" the statement read.

It's a razor-sharp throwback from writer-director Rian Johnson, which almost feels like a palate cleanser after directing the last \"Star Wars\" movie.The premise can be summed up neatly enough, with the apparent-suicide death of bestselling mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), the 85-year-old patriarch of a highly dysfunctional family. The circumstances, however, leave everyone looking like a potential suspect -- there's the little matter of that estate, after all -- and thrust Harlan's nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) squarely into the midst of the craziness.Tasked with unraveling it all, meanwhile, is Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who speaks in a Foghorn Leghorn Southern drawl (a point overtly made) and is described as \"the last of the gentleman sleuths.\" Blanc spends a fair amount of time appraising the familial quirks, while saying Holmes-ian lines like \"The game is afoot\" and referring to a sidekick as \"Watson.\"As for the family, everyone has a possible motive for wanting to do in ol' Harlan, including his grown kids (Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon), in-laws (Don Johnson, a scene-stealing Toni Collette) and grandchildren (Chris Evans, \"13 Reasons Why's\" Katherine Langford, \"It's\" Jaeden Martell), who each rely on papa bear's wealth and anticipated inheritance in one way or another.Christie's mysteries have never really gone out of fashion, and indeed, have mounted a bit of a comeback with new versions of \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and the upcoming \"Death on the Nile.\"Read MorePart of the charm involves seeing these stars get to flex some different muscles.

Produced by Ben Stiller, the project features a stellar cast, in a show about memory that proves appropriately hard to forget.The title refers to a procedure practiced by corporate giant Lumon Industries in which employees sever their memories of what transpires at work from what happens outside, and vice versa, theoretically bringing new meaning to the phrase \"work-life balance.\"Yet when a member of the team suddenly leaves, and a newcomer arrives, it upsets the chemistry within the office, triggering thoughts about what really might be motivating the practice -- and what the company might actually be doing that its robotic, happy-talking top brass appear eager to avoid.Answers don't come quickly, but the scenario becomes utterly fascinating, with Adam Scott as Mark Scout, the low-key new leader of the team; and Britt Lower as Helly, the new arrival who asks way too many questions.All told, it's enough to make even those pining for the office appreciate Zoom calls. As for the aforementioned cast, Lumon's personnel roster includes John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Zach Cherry, Tramell Tillman and Patricia Arquette, the last reuniting with Stiller after the splendid 2018 prison drama \"Escape at Dannemora.\"Read MoreFor Mark, the severed memories have served a particular purpose, allowing him to create distance between work and the pain he was experiencing after the loss of his wife.Scott turns out to be the perfect Everyman, but the cast is uniformly good. Why the others would agree to this Faustian bargain is only one of the breadcrumbs that \"Severance\" takes its time sprinkling, in a series that leaves plenty of runway for more at the end of its nine episodes.Created by Dan Erickson, there's a \"Twin Peaks\"-esque quality to some of the quirkier aspects of the series, such as Arquette's monotone-voiced boss informing Mark that \"A handshake is available upon request,\" the walks down impossibly long hallways or the odd obsession with melon balls at the awkward company celebrations. The show also invites comparisons to the under-appreciated AMC drama \"Rubicon\" and ahead-of-its-time 1960s series \"The Prisoner,\" given the confined setting and uncertainty about who can be trusted.\"Severance\" won't be for everyone, but those drawn into its antiseptic, maze-like workspace won't be able to get enough of its provocative implications about messing around with the brain and memories, a la the movie \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"Light escapism it isn't. But until the show's fictional technology becomes reality, a series like \"Severance\" is just the sort of cerebral concept to help take one's mind off the daily grind of working 9 to 5.\"Severance\" premieres Feb. 18 on Apple TV+.

In the former's case, it was Wanda working through her grief, while consciously satirizing the long history of sitcoms. In the latter, the story built toward the transfer of Captain America's shield into new and deserving hands.Loki being gender fluid confirmed in trailer\"Loki,\" by contrast, initially exists primarily as a showcase for Hiddleston, picking up the string from a loose end in \"Avengers: Endgame\" and teasing it out (and out).As the introduction reminds us, Loki escaped into parts unknown during the events of \"Endgame,\" as the Avengers tinkered with the past to alter the future. The result of that has left a Loki \"variant\" (a term with another distracting usage right now) on the loose, drawing the attention of an organization whose mandate is to police the time continuum.The problem with time-travel plots is that they tend to work best the less you dwell on the details. Thanks to the premise, the audience can think about little else, since the source of the drama (and considerable comedy) fixates on the threat that a glitch in time poses to reality itself.Read MoreThe program's primary kick thus boils down to Hiddleston, as well as his interactions with time cop Mobius (Owen Wilson), who realizes Loki isn't trustworthy but sees him as the means to an end. An early template would be \"It Takes a Thief,\" where a skilled cat burglar's insights were employed to help catch other thieves.With the time element and buddy aspect of that, the opening episodes could be called \"Tom and Owen's Excellent Adventure.\" There's less to do for the rest of the cast, which includes Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Mobius' boss.On the plus side, \"Loki\" looks fabulous, creating a bizarre world that feels distinctly different from other quadrants of the Marvel universe. Being weird, however \u2014 especially in those moments when it seems to be mostly for the sake of that \u2014 has its drawbacks too.For the most part, Marvel has proven exceptionally shrewd in capitalizing on the Disney+ platform to offer richer characterizations than the movies allow, while providing the streaming service with marquee titles that echo through the pop-culture space.Early on, the series asks a question at the heart of its appeal: \"What makes Loki tick?\" \"Loki\" clearly could have more tricks up its sleeve, since the format has dictated that these Marvel shows can only truly be judged at the end, not the beginning.Even so, the clock is ticking on whether the series can rally enough during the remaining chapters to fulfill its promise, as opposed to simply killing time.\"Loki\" premieres Wednesday, June 9, on Disney+."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2019", "month": "10", "day": "1"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Congrats are in order again for Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey Baldwin.

Shonda Rhimes caught lightning in a bottle for Netflix with \"Bridgerton,\" but her latest creation is less likely to have tongues wagging.Rhimes has populated the show with a number of familiar faces from her ABC/\"Scandal\" days, but the marquee parts go to Julia Garner (\"Ozark\"), sporting an accent seemingly patterned after Balki in \"Perfect Strangers,\" and Anna Chlumsky (\"Veep\"). Even if Garner's character, Anna Delvey, actually sounded this way, listening to it for nine episodes borders on becoming a distraction at best, and an ear-bending ordeal at worst.While taking liberties with the story, the underlying bones of it are pretty sensational: Delvey, a \"fake heiress,\" beguiled the Manhattan elite and banks alike, worming her way into high society before the walls came crashing down and landed her in a courtroom.Julia Garner as Anna Delvery in 'Inventing Anna' (David Giesbrecht/Netflix).Delvey lived the good life, creating an image that fooled plenty of people and left many reluctant to discuss their relationships with her. That included running up expenses like a $62,000 trip to Morocco, with a friend (played by \"Scandal's\" Katie Lowes) holding the bill.Anna's story was a tough one to crack, due in part to the reticence of those she fooled. Enter Chlumsy's Vivian, who doggedly pursues Anna and her friends, trying to expose not just what happened but who Anna really is and where that peculiar accent might have originated. (The show is based on a New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler.)Read MoreStrictly as a viewing proposition it doesn't help that most of the episodes run more than an hour, which breeds a certain flabbiness in the storytelling. The same goes for a structure that shifts the focus to a different one of Anna's marks in each chapter, jumping back and forth in time before reaching the trial and eventually deciding her fate.Along the way Vivian and Anna have several prison interviews, but we're expected to accept that the reporter has bonded with her \u2014 or at least finds her oddly endearing, for reasons that frankly seem mystifying \u2014 even as she struggles to meet her deadline, hold her life together and, oh yeah, have a baby.If that sounds like a lot, it is, with a tone that's often whimsical. The flashbacks generally work better than Vivian's part of the story, which provides a reminder that portraying the practice of journalism in drama can be a thorny proposition, with a whole lot of misfires for every \"All the President's Men.\"Those criticisms don't completely undercut the meatiness of the story, and the schadenfreude of how all these privileged masters and mistresses of the universe were so easily deceived.

Like most of the others, this beyond-grim drama falls short, at least initially, despite a strong cast headed by Diane Lane as the US' new leader.Unlike \"Walking Dead,\" which essentially skipped over the outset of the zombie outbreak, \"Y\" rather ghoulishly wades into it, counting down to that moment when the entire male population (everything with a Y chromosome) abruptly and inexplicably dies, leaving behind a world consisting of women, with notable exceptions.There's a touch of \"The Leftovers\" in the arbitrary nature of events, followed by the crumbling of the social order and frantic attempts to maintain it. Much of that falls to survivors lead by congresswoman Jennifer Brown (Lane), who stands tall amid the global chaos and isn't spared from partisan politics even during these extraordinary circumstances.Brown's resources include a nameless government agent (Ashley Romans) who is both deadly and ruthless, but even when the government begins to coalesce, she's hardly out of the woods in terms of cascading crises.In a sense, you almost have to get past the first few episodes for \"Y\" to settle into its dramatic arc, following multiple plots that include the lone cisgender male survivor, Yorick Brown (Ben Schnetzer), who must hide his identity. Yorick also has a pet monkey that's male, and both have \"future lab rat\" written all over them.Read MoreSuch science-fiction series generally begin somewhere after everything has gone to hell, so at first the show appears to deserve credit for trying something different by building up to the equivalent of the nuclear blast or lethal plague that suddenly changes everything. The wholesale deaths, however, and associated grief of those left behind cast a pall over the series, which with a few exceptions struggles to develop the kind of characters that made \"Walking Dead\" pop originally.Don't expect any immediate answers, either, about the \"why\" of the \"last man,\" as the concept -- based on Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra's DC comic -- lurches forward in a way that feels relentlessly bleak and depressing. While no one would expect the dystopian concept to yield feel-good TV, watching society break down this way, at this moment, has a glutton-for-punishment quality without outlandish wrinkles like zombie gore to introduce a sense of escapism.In addition to the overwhelmingly female cast, all the directors and most of the key crew members are women, working under showrunner Eliza Clark, a playwright whose TV credits include TNT's \"Animal Kingdom.\"Ultimately, though, the series feels handcuffed by the device that sets the narrative in motion.

Still, danger could lurk ahead -- not in the form of a supervillain, but rather a hunger for content that will test Marvel's thus-far formidable limits.Marvel's arsenal is about to grow, via another Disney acquisition. Two signature properties, Fantastic Four and X-Men, will be reunited with their comic-book brethren, one of the benefits of parent Disney's pending absorption of Fox Entertainment holdings.Movie rights to those titles had been parceled off years ago, when Marvel Comics faced financial difficulties. While \"X-Men\" has produced a profitable series of movies, attempts to bring \"Fantastic Four\" to the screen have proved disappointing.Still, Disney's reliance on Marvel is about to grow, creating pressure to expand what's known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The company has generally been shrewd in that regard, but even Earth's mightiest heroes have exhibited vulnerabilities -- especially in television -- as the company reaches farther and wider to bring less-well-known titles to the screen.Read MoreMarvel is one of the centerpieces of Disney's strategy as the studio prepares to launch its own streaming service, joining other key assets -- especially \"Star Wars\" and Disney/Pixar animated hits -- in providing a come-on to consumers.In an interview with ComicBook.com, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige stated that programs coming to the streaming venture, known as Disney+, will be \"entirely interwoven with both the current MCU, the past MCU, and the future of the MCU.\"It's an ambitious scheme, and Marvel has demonstrated its ability to create an interlocking franchise, while transforming titles that were hardly on the tips of most people's tongues -- like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Ant-Man\" -- into rousing successes. If anything, the company's savvy exploitation of second-tier properties has been as much a linchpin of its unblemished box-office resume as its marquee heroes.Brie Larson as 'Captain Marvel'With pressure to feed Disney's need for premium, must-have content, the company is going to have to keep reaching further into its grab bag. That includes not only movies and Disney+, but servicing ABC, cable network Freeform, children's channels like DisneyXD and the other streaming service that Disney controls, Hulu.As enviable as Marvel's track record has been, unlike Iron Man, it's not invincible. Although the studio has remarkably avoided a major box-office misfire -- as even Lucasfilm experienced with \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" -- ABC's \"The Inhumans\" flopped, and an attempt to spin off \"Agents of SHIELD\" died in development.Creatively speaking, Marvel's Netflix shows -- among them \"Iron Fist\" and \"The Punisher\" -- also fell well short of Marvel's top tier, even if it's difficult to quantify their commercial performance.Marvel is staying relatively mum about its output for Disney+, holding back announcements until after this spring and summer's movies. Several new shows, however, are being planned, including one built around the Avengers characters Vision and Scarlet Witch, and another featuring the Thor villain Loki.In addition, the company has announced a quirky animation lineup for Hulu, with four series in the works, among them \"Howard the Duck.\"Howard the Duck, of course, was a much-admired comic book that was turned into a 1986 movie, which laid such a conspicuous egg at the box office as to serve as a kind of shorthand for a misguided flop.A lot has changed for the better since then when it comes to comic-book adaptations, and Marvel has made clear that it feels emboldened to tell all kinds of stories, big and small, just as Lucasfilm is mining various quadrants of its galaxy far, far away.Yet as with any creative endeavor, the more at-bats taken, the greater the chance of striking out. Marvel remains the envy of the movie industry, but as the studio stretches to explore the outer expanse of its universe, the risk will only increase in terms of scrambling those well-laid plans."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "4"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "\"The Batman\" presents a muscular vision of the Dark Knight that hardcore fans have long desired, a dark and serious epic, detective-driven take.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)\"The Batman\" presents a muscular vision of the Dark Knight that hardcore fans have long desired, a dark and serious epic that's somewhat offset by two disclaimers: At nearly three hours, the movie hangs around too long, really feeling it down the stretch; and despite its origins, this detective-driven take owes more to movies like \"Seven\" and \"L.A. Confidential\" than other superhero fare.First, the very good news: Robert Pattinson is terrific as a young, brooding Batman/Bruce Wayne, narrating his story in a hard-bitten style that recalls the hushed tones of Dirty Harry and the film noir detectives played by Humphrey Bogart.Batman again operates in a corrupt, muddy-toned Gotham whose ornate trappings are part New York, part \"Blade Runner,\" and when pressed into action, his fights are bruising, not balletic. The look might be stylized, but director/co-writer Matt Reeves has steeped Wayne's tragic history in gritty realism, even more so than Christopher Nolan's trilogy starring Christian Bale.While running through the cast, there's also plenty to praise in Zo\u00eb Kravitz's Catwoman (a name never uttered, despite her fondness for felines), Jeffrey Wright's James Gordon and Paul Dano's Riddler. The last is dangerous, homicidal and enigmatic in a way that pushes the movie to the edge of its PG-13 rating, bearing a greater resemblance to Heath Ledger's Joker than Jim Carrey's manic incarnation, much less the colorful 1960s version.For those reasons and others, \"The Batman\" begins extremely well, introducing the masked vigilante -- still viewed warily by authorities two years into his on-the-job training -- as he teams with Gordon to investigate a grisly, high-profile murder. Lurking in shadows, the Riddler engages them in a game of cat and mouse, sprinkling clues and taunting Batman, who has sought to strike fear into criminals' hearts, rumbling when one asks who he is, \"I'm vengeance.\"Read MoreThe mystery carries through a dense mythology that incorporates not only the tainted foundation upon which Gotham rests, but Batman's origins (although for once, happily, they dispense with reenacting the murders that orphaned him). Those details emerge in part via Wayne's interplay with the loyal Alfred (Andy Serkis), while Catwoman/Selina harbors separate but equally grim motives.Robert Pattinson and Zo\u00eb Kravitz star in 'The Batman.'However resourceful Batman is, Riddler actually drives the story, in much the way \"Seven's\" killer led those detectives on a not-so-merry chase that left a trail of victims. As clues pile up, more and more of Gotham's power players get drawn into that web, with the Penguin (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell), the top henchman to mob boss Falcone (John Turturro), adding to the Rogues Gallery of villains.The script by Reeves and Peter Craig in some respects echoes \"Batman: Year One,\" portraying the character at a more nascent phase, if not a completely green one. The look reflects the art of Neal Adams and Marshall Rogers, whose work in the '70s helped redefine Batman and cast off the remnants of \"Biff! Wham! Pow!\" lightness and camp.While the seriousness is welcome, the level of darkness risks becoming oppressive in a manner that doesn't leave much room for fun of any kind. If that's hardly a negative for Batman-ologists, it threatens to blunt the film's appeal among those who can't identify the issue of Detective Comics in which he first appeared.Still, that's a modest quibble compared to the main gripe that \"The Batman\" could easily lose 30 minutes without sacrificing much. Most of that flab comes during the final hour, which serves a purpose in terms of the character's maturation but piles on at least one climax too many.That's a shame, really, because Reeves gets so much right that indulging in a \"Snyder cut\"-length flex from the get-go feels like an unforced error. Given what a major box-office attraction the film should be for hungry theaters and Warner Bros. (like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia), plus the likelihood of sequels, there was no need to overstay its welcome.Batman has a long history of provoking passionate reactions and debate, and the latest entry will be no exception. In Pattinson, the producers have found a Dark Knight worthy of the hoopla, while creating a Gotham much in need of him.As new chapters go, it's a strong beginning; if only it had known when to end.\"The Batman\" premieres March 4 in US theaters.

Uslan (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for TCM)His passion burned into adulthood as he attended Indiana University, where he pitched the folklore department with a then-unheard-of take on comic book heroes as a pantheon of modern mythology: the Flash was analog to the Greek god Hermes and the Romans' Mercury, and so on.When a dean who'd read comics as a kid dismissed Uslan's pitch as preposterous, Uslan asked him to recount the story of Moses, then pointed out the undeniable parallels to Superman's well-known origin. \"He stops, stares at me for a veritable eternity and then says, 'Your course is accredited,'\" says Uslan. \"I then became the first college professor of comic books, ever.\"Read MoreWith some sly self-promotion, Uslan's popular class became the subject of much media coverage. Suddenly he'd receive supportive phone calls from Stan Lee (\"Which I always refer to as my burning bush,\" he quipped, as well as DC Comics' soon-to-be president Sol Harrison, who flew Uslan into New York and found ways to put his skills to use for the company between semesters -- a connection that cemented his connection to his favorite comic book superhero of all, Batman.Cover illustration for 'World's Finest Comics,' with Superman, Batman and Robin selling US War Bonds to sink the 'Japanazis' in World War II, 1940s.\"I began to write Batman comics, which was my dream since I was eight years old,\" Uslan recalls -- a wish-fulfillment that panicked him for \"ten minutes\" until he formulated his next dream, one that had been percolating since 1966 when the much-anticipated \"Batman\" TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward debuted, shocking the young Uslan with its campy, tongue-in-cheek take on the hero he knew had dark, gothic roots.\"All I can describe the night to you is I was simultaneously thrilled and horrified by what I was seeing on TV,\" he remembers. \"As a hardcore fanboy who really knew the whole history of Batman, this was not the true Batman. This was not the creature of the night stalking disturbed criminals in the shadows. I realized they were making fun of Batman. It was being done as a comedy, and the world was laughing at Batman.\"\"That night, I made a vow, like Bruce Wayne once made a vow: 'Somehow, someday I will show the world the true Batman and attempt to eliminate from the collective consciousness of the world culture these new words, 'Pow! Zap! and Wham!'\"By the early '70s, legendary comics writer Dennis O'Neil and revolutionary artist Neal Adams had successfully initiated a return to the moodier, shadowy tone that distinguished co-creator Bob Kane and Bill Finger's earliest Batman stories, a move that fans and fellow creators embraced as a means of washing away the bad taste left among the faithful by the TV series, which had been hugely, but only briefly, all-pervasive in its popularity.Uslan, who by then had secured a job in the film industry, went to DC's Harrison with a new pitch: \"I want to buy the rights to Batman, and I want to make a dark and serious Batman movie and show the world the true Batman.\" Harrison urged him to reconsider. \"'The brand is as dead as a dodo,'\" Uslan remembers being told, \"He said to me, 'Michael, nobody's interested in Batman anymore.'\"But Uslan soldiered forward, teaming in 1979 with the esteemed former MGM exec Benjamin Melnicker to purchase and peddle the film and television rights.\"I was turned down by every studio and every mini-major,\" says Uslan. \"They told me basically it was the worst idea they ever heard, that I was crazy. You can't do serious comic book movies. You can't do dark superheroes. You can't make a movie out of an old television series. It's never been done.\"Writer-artist Frank Miller's 1985 landmark Batman miniseries \"The Dark Knight Returns\" provided a boost to Uslan's argument that the hero could thrive in the darkest, grittiest and most psychologically complex of storylines, to widespread, mainstream attention.\"What it did was it convinced both Hollywood and the general public that comic books were maturing and growing up and were no longer just for little kids,\" says Uslan. \"That change in perception was critically important to this movie getting up, and then an atmosphere of acceptance for it.\"Soon an up-and-coming filmmaker named Tim Burton, known for his imaginative, edgy visual sense and affection for freakish characters came aboard. Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Keaton with director Tim Burton on the set of his movie 'Batman Returns.' It was Burton who cracked the code. \"He had the vision,\" says Uslan. \"He knew how to do the world's first revolutionary, dark, serious comic book superhero movie. He said to me, 'This movie, if we're going to do it this way and not get unintentional laughs from the audience, is not about Batman. It's got to be about Bruce Wayne. We have to show a Bruce Wayne so obsessed and driven to the point of being psychotic that audiences will go, oh yeah, that's a guy who would get dressed up as a bat and go out and do that.' It was critical to the whole suspension of disbelief.\"\"Then he said 'Gotham City has to be the third most important character of this movie,\" Uslan adds \"From the opening frames of the movie, we have to convince audiences that Gotham City is real, because that's the only way they'll accept a guy like Batman and the Joker seriously.' He was absolutely right about it.\"Suddenly, seemingly disparate pieces began to form a compelling whole: Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson signed on to play the Joker, a role that seemed tailor-made for him; Burton's choice of his \"Beetlejuice\" collaborator Michael Keaton, known primarily for comedy, to play Batman launched endless fan debates over the film's serious intentions; Prince, the reigning pop music genius of the moment provided a funky soundtrack, while former Oingo Boingo frontman Danny Elfman delivered a broody, operatic score; another Oscar winner, production designer Anton Furst, fully realized a Gotham City that was one part industrial oppression, one part gothic monument.Michael Keaton on the set of 'Batman' Somehow, it all coalesced, and, as the character turned 50 years old, a blockbuster franchise was born -- one that would boost comic sales, launch a toy and merchandising dynasty, spawn further film and TV iterations as well as a fresh superheroic cinema genre and, perhaps most importantly, reimagine Batman as the dark avenger of the night he was always meant to be (fond memories of Adam West notwithstanding).\"My belief was always 'Let's just find great filmmakers who love this character, have an understanding and knowledge of it, have a vision for it,'\" says Uslan, whose name continues to grace the credits of every subsequent Batman television and film production. \"With Batman in particular, it's about story, story, story and character, character, character. It's not about blowing stuff up and showing off special effects. It's about his humanity...It's important to always respect the character, who's now celebrating his 80th Anniversary."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "6", "day": "22"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Joel Schumacher, an eclectic director whose career ranged from a pair of divisive Batman movies to \"St. Elmo's Fire,\" died Monday after a year-long battle with cancer, a representative for Schumacher told CNN.

Superman: Dawn of Justice.Comic-Con: Ben Affleck's 'Batman' makes an appearanceThe Oscar-winning director-star has both a sense of perspective and humor about the most recent meme to hybridize his name.Briefly on hiatus from filming the mega-budget superhero action flick in Detroit to attend San Diego's Comic-Con International\u2014where Affleck stunned the crowd, appearing alongside co-star Henry Cavill and director Zack Snyder to debut footage from Batman v. Superman but giving no interviews\u2014Affleck appeared to have packed on pounds of muscle in the service of portraying a decidedly un-Bale-like kind of Batman/Bruce Wayne. That is, one in his mid-forties, his hair flecked with grey.'Batman v Superman': Meet your new AquamanHe remained tight-lipped about the particulars of the 3D follow-up to Snyder's Man of Steel that's set to reach theaters in March 2016, part of a DC cinematic universe that will also eventually include a Justice League movie. But for the first time, Affleck addressed certain issues\u2014in particular, the fan freak-out surrounding his casting\u2014 about which he's until now remained resolutely silent.EW: So what it's like to portray Batman?Ben Affleck: I'm right in the middle of shooting now. It's a process that I'll probably have better perspective on when I'm done. I can tell you that every time I do a role, it's the responsibility of an actor to get their physical self as close to the role as possible. And Batman's obviously got a set of expectations that are tough. So I spent a lot of time working out. And it's a far cry from Gone Girl where my character is described as \"puffy and hungover.\" I want you to know I worked equally hard at both! [laughs]Affleck says tabloid scrutiny helped 'Gone Girl'EW: It feels slightly ridiculous using the word \"outcry\" describing your casting. But there was actual outcry\u2014a lot of people freaked when they heard about Batfleck. To what extent did all that get under your skin?Affleck: Before I took the role, Warner Bros. gave me a bunch of past reactions to casting and said, \"Are you sure you want to get into this? This is part and parcel of these movies now. There's a lot of active fans with a lot of opinions.\" To me, having been through a certain amount of that, it doesn't really... Everyone's entitled to their opinion. I wouldn't have taken the part if I didn't trust my instincts in terms of the filmmaking. I think Chris Terrio wrote a terrific script. Zack's a great visual director. And there's an interesting take. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think I could do it. I have the benefit of a lot of that understanding. But also, everyone is entitled to their opinion. That's a big part of this international sport. The Fifty Shades of Grey kid or whatever it is. That's sort of become a thing.Affleck will be a great Batman, Adam West saysEW: Fans feel like their vote counts.Affleck: You know what? It's great that people do care that much. They want to see the movie that much. And it is incumbent on you to honor the story. There are the Greek myths and these are the American myths. The American myths are these superheroes.

While the movie might not have been a commercial slam dunk, it's hard not to admire a premise that dares to tackle such lofty ideas as life after death and what makes living worthwhile, as filtered through the hopes and dreams of Joe Gardner (voiced by Jamie Foxx).A middle-school music teacher, Joe has spent his life yearning to make it as a musician, pursuing gigs at the expense of his career. When the opportunity suddenly presents itself to live out those dreams, his distracted glee leads to his untimely demise -- a real bummer, considering that he had just said he \"could die a happy man\" if he got to play with the musician that had offered him the chance.Awakening on the escalator to the hereafter, Joe makes a desperate break to go back, leading to a fairly amusing tour of what the great beyond might resemble. While that animation is customarily lush, the actual character design of the \"souls\" is rounded and simple -- a bit like the Poppin' Fresh doughboy, only a slightly eerie shade of blue.In the process, Joe encounters a young soul in what's known as The Great Before, 22 (Tina Fey), who has long resisted embarking upon the journey to Earth, despite a hilarious roster of mentors that includes a who's who of historical figures.Read MoreIt's around here where \"Soul\" really begins to leave small fry behind, unless your preteen is apt to get jokes about George Orwell and Mother Teresa.Pixar's 'Soul.'Ultimately, Joe and 22 do find their way to Earth, but not in the way (or form) he expected, leading to a madcap series of encounters as he seeks to achieve what he sees as his life's purpose.That section of the movie unfolds cleverly enough, but it's the resolution that really brings the whole idea home. The emotional nature of that experience recalls the opening sequence in \"Up,\" which silently chronicled a lifetime of love and ultimately loss, leaving many adults in the theater (ah, theaters) sobbing while their kids waited to get to the talking dog and airborne house.\"Soul\" also features a wonderful score, since music is fundamental to the story, provided by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross with jazz compositions courtesy of Jon Batiste -- again, not something likely to be fully appreciated by the tykes on the couch.Aside from Foxx and Fey, the voice cast includes Phylicia Rashad, Angela Bassett and Graham Norton and Daveed Diggs.Of course, the idea of animation tackling big, existential themes is welcome, and the \"Soul\" creative team deserves enormous credit for the effort. Yet one suspects translating that into the sort of box-office stampede Pixar has enjoyed with movies like the \"Toy Story\" and \"Incredibles\" franchises would have been challenging, making the direct-to-streaming gambit less of a financial sacrifice.Either way, \"Soul\" is highly recommended -- especially to adults who might not be otherwise inclined -- and a return to form for Pixar after the less-satisfying \"Onward.\" Parents wanting to really enjoy it, however, might want to watch at least once without their kids, who, understandably, will be less cognizant of choices made, roads not taken and where their own escalators might lead them.\"Soul\" premieres Dec. 25 on Disney+.

Although the movie touches on familiar themes about friendship, overcoming differences and letting children go, there's roughly enough story for something between an animated short and the film that lands, understandably in hindsight, via Disney+ instead of theaters.The title character owes a debt to another curious ocean-dweller that helped launch the modern resurgence of Disney animation, \"The Little Mermaid.\" Discontented with his life under the sea, Luca (voiced by \"Room's\" Jason Tremblay) yearns for an existence he can scarcely fathom above the waves, which seems magical to a young sea monster (or \"little merman,\" in a sense).Naturally, Luca's inquisitive nature exasperates his mother (Maya Rudolph), who warns him, \"The curious fish gets caught.\" Indeed, he's introduced nearly doing just that, coming too close to the fishing nets of a \"land monster\" from the quaint village nearby in the Italian Riviera.On shore, for some reason, sea monsters assume human form, which is where Luca meets Alberto (\"It'\" and \"Shazam!'s\" Jack Dylan Grazer), a slightly older sea monster with a wandering spirit who has this whole land thing down -- or at least, insists that he does. Their joint discoveries carry the story for a while, before they meet a human girl, Giulia (Emma Berman), who gives them the half-baked idea of entering a local race, and dazzles Luca with tales of her world.It's around then that the film, directed by Enrico Casarosa (whose credits include the Oscar-nominated Pixar short \"La Luna\"), begins to feel like it's treading water, as the boys experience a rift thanks to Luca's friendship with Giulia, and weather a series of near misses every time one of them gets wet, at the risk of exposing what amount to their secret identities.Read MoreTwo sea monsters get a taste of dry land in Pixar's 'Luca' (Disney+).Pixar movies have a habit for finding simple truths and tugging at the heartstrings, and \"Luca\" accomplishes some of that deftly enough before it's over.Mostly, though, it's a bit of a bore when ashore -- another tale of a kid who feels misunderstood and runs away from home (or the reef), forcing his parents (Jim Gaffigan plays dad) to contemplate whether they've been too rigid in demanding that he adhere to family traditions.At its best, the film offers lovely glimpses of Italy, while adding to the relatively modest subgenre of human/sea-creature relations. There's also a deeper undercurrent in the theme of hiding who you are.Otherwise, it's the sort of generic concept that's pleasant enough but falls short of the high standards Pixar has set, and after the disappointing \"Onward,\" recently achieved again with \"Soul,\" which exemplified the ambition that \"Luca\" (the movie, not the character) conspicuously lacks. That applies to the casting as well, which includes squandering Sacha Baron Cohen in a throwaway role.Studios have engaged in an imprecise science in deciding how best to exhibit films since the pandemic began, in some instances seemingly leaving money on the table by redirecting movies to streaming or offering them at home simultaneously with their release.In the case of \"Luca,\" it's easy to see why Disney opted to bypass theaters and go with the streaming flow. Because while it's not bad, the movie ultimately feels like a little fish in a big pond.\"Luca\" premieres June 18 on Disney+.

The less admirable qualities involve the protracted, slightly chaotic nature of the quest, and a certain \"Weekend at Bernie's\" vibe as the pair lug dad around in his half-there state.Co-written and directed by Dan Scanlon (who has cited losing his father at a young age as inspiration), \"Onward\" certainly doesn't lack for ambition. The movie also breaks ground by fleetingly featuring the first overtly LGBTQ character in one of the studio's animated movies (voiced by Lena Waithe), a relatively low-key milestone after the whole \"Will she come out?\" fever that surrounded \"Frozen 2.\"Only a true cynic could wholly resist \"Onward's\" deeper themes, but they come in the service of a movie that has to be classified in the mid-level tier of the Pixar file.To be fair, falling short of gems like \"Up,\" \"Ratatouille\" and \"Inside Out\" (the last being perhaps the film's closest thematic cousin) isn't bad company, and it's nice to see another wholly original concept after a string of Pixar sequels.

Together, they underscore what \"Hamilton\" so impressively accomplished by conjuring that elusive magic. Notably, HBO Max's \"The West Wing\" special also captures some of that by bringing a TV show to the stage for the purposes of watching at home. (Like CNN, HBO is a unit of WarnerMedia.)Byrne, the Talking Heads front man, has always possessed a theatrical and cinematic flair, including his 1986 directorial effort \"True Stories.\" Those qualities inform \"American Utopia,\" a collection of songs -- imaginatively choreographed and lit -- that conveys the joyous and playful aspects of his music.On the plus side, that sense of fun is entertaining enough. The main drawback is that while Byrne addresses pressing issues during his chatting with the audience -- including the importance of voting, and introducing his performance of Janelle Monae's \"Hell You Talmbout,\" name-checking Black people killed by police -- there's scant thematic adhesive to the presentation, unlike some other productions wedding rock to Broadway (Bruce Springsteen's \"Springsteen on Broadway,\" filmed for Netflix, comes to mind).Lee does an admirable job of shooting the performance from every conceivable angle, although while the overhead shots are quite cool, one could probably do without closeups on Byrne's feet, which along with the rest of the performers, are bare.Read MoreByrne's playlist includes the hit \"Burning Down the House,\" and a boisterous rendition of \"Road to Nowhere,\" which includes a march through the appreciative audience.\"American Utopia\" doesn't set the screen ablaze, but Byrne and his collaborators certainly know how to put on a show, even when it feels like they're going nowhere.Heidi Schreck in 'What the Constitution Means to Me'\"What the Constitution Means to Me,\" by contrast, is an audacious idea, one that starts slowly -- at least in this format -- before sinking in its hooks about halfway through.Playwright-star Schreck (a Tony nominee on both scores) earned college tuition money by competing in Constitutional debates, and revives her 15-year-old self to explore -- humorously at first, pointedly later -- its troubling and inequitable aspects, including mistreatment of women.Schreck's reminiscing about \"Dirty Dancing\" and visiting legion halls to wax eloquently about the Constitution to mostly older men come into sharper focus when she exits the time capsule, and pivots to speaking in her 40-something voice.At that moment her memories and observations become sharper, from the patriarchal values of the court to violence against women to her own experience with abortion.\"When abortion became illegal, it didn't become rare,\" she says, referencing the days before Roe v. Wade. \"It only became deadly.\"Schreck closes by engaging in a debate with a teen orator, Rosdely Ciprian, about whether the Constitution is indeed the living, breathing document that we've been taught to admire in school -- adaptable to the modern age -- or a hopelessly dated construct that needs to be discarded, starting over from scratch. It's an interesting device, while lacking the impact of the material that precedes it.Directed by Marielle Heller (\"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\"), \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" serves as a reminder that those pining for the past tend to ignore historic inequalities. There's even quotation from the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- who caused a stir when she saw the show last year -- which makes the special feel extra timely and poignant.Minor drawbacks aside, both shows have plenty to recommend them. And if live theater means anything to you, they provide at least a taste of what you're missing.\"What the Constitution Means to Me\" premieres Oct. 16 on Amazon.\"American Utopia\" premieres Oct. 17 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "7", "day": "8"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "\"I found out two days ago that I'm pregnant,\" Amy Schumer says tearfully at the start of the \"Expecting Amy.\" \"Maybe I'll document it or something.\" That translates into a three-part docuseries, and a test of one's fandom level toward the comic/actor, offering a very-personal account of her gestation process for two things: The baby she had last year, and a Netflix stand-up special.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)\"I found out two days ago that I'm pregnant,\" Amy Schumer says tearfully at the start of the \"Expecting Amy.\" \"Maybe I'll document it or something.\" That translates into a three-part docuseries, and a test of one's fandom level toward the comic/actor, offering a very-personal account of her gestation process for two things: The baby she had last year, and a Netflix stand-up special.Primarily shot by Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, using their phones, viewers should be forewarned that Schumer had an extremely difficult pregnancy, and this HBO Max presentation illustrates that by showing her throwing up in a variety of locales. In fact, it's hard not to think about Fischer snatching up his phone every time his wife becomes nauseous so he can capture the moment, which speaks to a certain level of commitment to the process.The degree of personal detail is a testament, in theory, to Schumer's unflinching openness, and highlights the balance associated with juggling a pregnancy and work -- in this case, a high-profile career touring clubs to hone her material.That proves to be the more unique aspect of this project, seeing Schumer workshop and fine-tune her act. In addition, there's the friction that ensues over her decision to talk about her husband -- diagnosed with being on what she calls the \"mild\" end of the autism spectrum -- as part of the show.Amy Schumer in 'Expecting Amy.'Directed and edited by Alexander Hammer (who worked on Beyonc\u00e9's \"Homecoming\"), \"Expecting Amy's\" journey includes video of the couple's wedding, tracking Schumer as she participates in protests against then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and moments in which she brings her dog on stage, again demonstrating that pooches remain the ultimate scene-stealers, even in a verit\u00e9-style documentary. Plus, lots of ultrasounds, run-ins with paparazzi and, lest anyone forget, vomiting.Read MoreSchumer seems mindful of the possibility the exercise will appear a tad self-indulgent, at one point asking if she sounds whiny, and during another looking directly into the camera and saying, \"Stars, they're just like us.\"Yet that is, inevitably, part of the appeal, as even a perfunctory glance at People and US Weekly would attest. For anyone who doesn't crave such access, Schumer's discussions with the likes of Colin Quinn and Jerry Seinfeld offer a more intriguing window into her professional world.\"I can always perform,\" Schumer says, despite feeling shaky physically. \"You just have to do your job.\"Comedians regularly invite audiences into their lives and heads, seeking to glean identifiable truths from their personal experiences. Because \"Expecting Amy\" offers such an intimate portrait, it's almost impossible to separate the project from the person, meaning one's interest level in Schumer going in will likely determine the extent to which this docuseries diary delivers.\"Expecting Amy\" premieres July 9 on HBO Max.

Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of \"Veep\" blush.Having become HBO's version of \"Game of Thrones\" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of \"fine wines\" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, \"Can I do this? Can I win?\"Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.Read MoreWhile Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by \"Succession\" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with \"Veep,\" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.\"Succession\" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that \"Game of Thrones\" comparison, the battles on \"Succession\" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake.

Bond as a brand is also at a crossroads, as tech giant Amazon (AMZN) plans to take over MGM, the home of the series.How \"No Time to Die\" performs this weekend and in coming weeks will have huge ramifications on the health of the theater industry and the future of 007.Read More\"The Bond franchise has always been done on a grand scale,\" Jonathan Kuntz, a film professor at UCLA School of Theater, Film and TV, told CNN Business. \"James Bond exemplifies the best in theatrical film.\"Kuntz added, \"Now, some are wondering in the 21st century, is there still space for that?\"Craig, Daniel Craig\"No Time to Die\" will be Daniel Craig's last performance as 007.\"No Time to Die\" is expected to bring in around $55 million to $60 million at the North American box office this weekend, estimates that are on the conservative side because of the pandemic. Given Craig's box office history, that total could be much higher.The James Bond franchise has racked up more than $7 billion worldwide, according to Comscore (SCOR). Of that total, Craig's outings as Bond (in \"Casino Royale,\" \"Quantum of Solace,\" \"Skyfall,\" \"Spectre\" and \"No Time to Die,\" which opened internationally last week) have brought in almost half that total, $3.3 billion. \"Daniel Craig's tenure has been one of the most beloved runs in the long history of 007,\" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, told CNN Business. \"He and the creative teams involved since 'Casino Royale' have made strides to modernize the franchise, and now they've had the chance to close their particular chapter on their terms.\"Daniel Craig explains why 'No Time to Die' is best experienced in a theater To be sure, Bond audiences skew much older than those who buy a ticket to see \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage,\" which made $90 million last weekend, and he doesn't have the Marvel name attached. But Bond is still Bond  \u2014 one of the most iconic characters in film history. Mix that with Craig's farewell performance and strong reviews (the film holds an 84% critic's score on Rotten Tomatoes), and the film's box office numbers could easily exceed expectations.Plus, the film has already made $121 million internationally so far and brought in $6.3 million in the US Thursday night, a solid start. For theaters, a big box office win for \"No Time to Die\" could keep the momentum going from the strong performance of \"Venom\" last weekend into the rest of October, which is vital if theaters want to keep moving in the right direction and go into 2022 strong. Other films have opened this year to mix results, but \"No Time to Die\" is arguably the most important film of the pandemic so far. If it's able to find an audience it could act as a bridge to a brighter future for theaters.\"There was a time in the '80s where it seemed like the James Bond films were going through the motions. But I think since 2006, each James Bond film has been carefully crafted,\" Kuntz said. \"It doesn't mean they've all been masterpieces, but they've given us something really new and visually stunning in the Bond films.\" Kuntz continued, \"The question is, is that enough? Is Bond enough? And if it's not, the theatrical film is in trouble.\"Bezos, Jeff BezosWhat will James Bond look like in the Amazon era?James Bond and wealthy, bald, technology-focused men have never really gotten along. (See the villain Blofeld in 1961's \"Thunderball.\") But now the spy will have to: his new boss is Jeff Bezos.Amazon purchased MGM, the studio behind Bond, for $8.4 billion in May. MGM, home to classic characters like Rocky Balboa and RoboCop, has more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows in its catalog. Yet the biggest catch is Bond.The studio owns a piece of the spy franchise, which Eon Productions also controls. However, beyond Bond's box office prowess, the films and their lead character represent a lifestyle that spreads across the globe and throughout pop culture. Bond is more than a mere piece of intellectual property \u2014 it's a vibe.And while streaming is a small part of Amazon's empire, the company has become a more prominent player in the entertainment world.Bond ratings: The best and worst of 007 as 'No Time to Die' marks Daniel Craig's exitPrime Video is tied to Amazon's popular Prime program, which offers faster package delivery and has more than 200 million paid subscribers. That makes it a strong competitor in the streaming marketplace, and having Bond in its ranks will likely bolster that position.But what does this mean for the cinematic future of Bond?Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who hold the rights to the character, are adamant that 007 will stay in theaters. But that doesn't mean that Bond or other characters from the series like M, Q, or Moneypenny won't appear elsewhere, much as the Star Wars or Marvel universes have done so successfully.\"I would expect some branching out to occur, likely with spin-off series and crossovers that focus on periphery characters within the 007 universe,\" Robbins said. \"Ultimately, though, the health of the brand is best maintained by making sure it continues to evolve without sacrificing part of what made it uniquely great to begin with: movie theaters.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2018", "month": "9", "day": "6"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is rethinking the addition of a popular film category to the Oscars after the idea proved to be largely unpopular.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is rethinking the addition of a popular film category to the Oscars after the idea proved to be largely unpopular.\"There has been a wide range of reactions to the introduction of a new award, and we recognize the need for further discussion with our members,\" said Academy CEO Dawn Hudson in a statement Thursday. \"We have made changes to the Oscars over the years -- including this year -- and we will continue to evolve while also respecting the incredible legacy of the last 90 years.\" The Academy announced in August that it intended to add a category for achievement in popular film, in hopes it would open the door to movies that might otherwise be overlooked in the best picture category.

Keeping the audience off balance, writer-director Jane Campion creates a slow, ominous build around the fine performances toward a satisfying conclusion that nicely pays off on the slow-canter ride.Marking the first film in 12 years from the director (who did do the TV series \"Top of the Lake\" in between), Campion has adapted a 1967 novel by Thomas Savage, set in Montana during the 1920s. While the western tone and subject matter has drawn comparisons to \"Brokeback Mountain,\" the story feels distinctive, and owes as much to Campion's signature movie \"The Piano\" with its strained relationships in a harsh, remote environment.The central tension stems from the bond between two brothers, who have grown up together on the family ranch but couldn't be more different. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is tethered to the past and tradition, as well as vaguely sadistic in his treatment of his brother George (Jesse Plemons), a quiet sort who he persists in calling \"Fatso.\"When George abruptly announces he's marrying an attractive widow, Rose (Kirsten Dunst, again paired with her off-screen partner after \"Fargo\"), Phil responds terribly and treats his brother's bride abusively. That discourteousness that also extends to her son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who Phil sees as being effeminate and cruelly teases along with the other cowhands.Life on the ranch takes its toll on Rose, but she's understandably concerned when Peter returns from school and begins spending time with Phil, who has seemingly taken it upon himself to make a man out of the boy, while reminiscing about his own schooling from a cowboy known as Bronco Henry. Yet his motives and virtually everyone else's remain suspect, creating a sense of menace and tension that lingers throughout.Read MoreThe cast is uniformly good, though Cumberbatch has the showiest role as the intense, brooding cowboy, who fears and resents change or any of the social niceties to which his brother aspires.

When asked after the ceremony by CNN's Stephanie Elam how he felt about the film's historic success, director Bong Joon Ho was still taking in the news. \"I think we destroyed the barrier too much!\" he joked, via translator Sharon Choi. \"I think it's great in life when things happen so fast and that's what's happening tonight.\"\"Parasite\" also picked up best director, best international feature film and best original screenplay. Heading into Sunday night, \"1917\" and \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" had been considered major competition for the movie. The question on the minds of many in Hollywood had been whether the Academy would put its votes toward those films -- the likes of which have been recognized in the past (a war epic and a star-packed film from a beloved director) -- or honor a filmmaker and cast less familiar to the mainstream. With the win for \"Parasite,\" the Academy made a choice to honor a film unlike any of those honored in the past 91 ceremonies. It's a victory for a community that still struggles to be seen -- one that comes in a year that had been criticized for a lack of individual nominees of color. (Only one actor of color -- Cynthia Erivo, star of \"Harriet\" -- was nominated this year in the major acting categories.) Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and author of \"Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism,\" previously told CNN that \"Parasite\" earning best picture could open up opportunities for Asian-American actors, who have a difficult time getting their work recognized on the awards circuit. (For example, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was a success at the box office and a milestone moment for Asian representation, but unsuccessful in its bid for Oscars recognition.)\"I think the fact that Asian Americans are rooting for 'Parasite' is because we still aren't even seeing ourselves in main dramatic roles,\" she said. \"The more Asians succeed on the international stage, I think Asian Americans do feel like that will then open up more opportunities for Asian-American actors in Hollywood.\"On social media, the win was hailed. Sandra Oh, who presented on Sunday night, said, \"Congratulations @ParasiteMovie So so proud to be Korean.\" \"The game has changed,\" wrote actor Lewis Tan. \"I'm in tears. This is historic.\" Actor Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, from \"Kim's Convenience\" added: \"Lookit all those Koreans onstage at the #Oscars. So proud my heart is bursting.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2015", "month": "10", "day": "8"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "After playing James Bond in four films, including the new \"Spectre,\" Daniel Craig is ready to put the role behind him.

But as an actor I don't want to give a f---k about what I look like! \"So I have to play with both things. In a way that works, as that's Bond: he looks good and he doesn't give a f---k what you think he looks like!' \"Craig said he's grateful for the opportunity but that the all-consuming role has kept him from pursuing other projects.\"Bond allows me to do anything I want to in some respects. But it's changed my working life in an incredible way. There are more opportunities. I could do many, many things. But it takes an awful amount of time. If anything, the restriction is that it is incredibly time-consuming.

Still, Daniel Craig's yeoman service comes to its conclusion with \"No Time to Die,\" a big and length-wise bloated epic that includes the desired bells and whistles, which, despite its flaws, should buy the movie considerable goodwill from an audience that has waited (and waited) for it.One of the original theatrical casualties of the pandemic, MGM delayed the release of Craig's fifth and final outing for 18 months, putting 15 years between his debut in \"Casino Royale\" and this chapter. While he hasn't lost a step, his editions of Bond have never quite equaled that dazzling introduction, and \"No Time to Die\" is no exception.To its credit, this two hour, 43-minute movie (thus making the title a bit of a lie) assiduously builds on everything that the recent Bond movies have established, in a way earlier incarnations generally didn't. That has deepened the character, allowing Bond to experience grief, loss and love without hitting the reset button, the recurrence of the villainous Blofeld notwithstanding.Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (\"True Detective\"), this Bond serves notice of its grand storytelling ambitions with perhaps the longest pre-credit sequence in memory, both introducing the mysterious new villain (played by Rami Malek, seemingly channeling Peter Lorre) and finding Bond happily retired.Of course, his post-service bliss can't last, as M (Ralph Fiennes) and his CIA pal Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) both endeavor to lure him back on a mission that involves a terrible bioweapon (maybe not the best time for that particular plot) and his old nemeses at Spectre, bringing back Madeleine Swann (L\u00e9a Seydoux) and the now-incarcerated Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) from that 2015 movie.Read MoreBond also finds his slot at MI6 having been ably occupied by a new agent (Lashana Lynch) who has inherited his 007 license. Yet while Lynch makes a strong addition, their squabbling banter is relatively weak, and merely adds to the abundance of moving parts that the even more-convoluted-than-usual plot has to service.An underlying theme is that the world has changed -- certainly from the Cold War period in which the character was born -- clouding alliances and making it, as Leiter muses, \"hard to tell good from bad.\" That measure of complexity, however, hasn't enhanced a formula built on world-threatening villains and muscular action.In terms of Bond staples, the movie does deliver some impressive chases and action sequences, with Ana de Armas (Craig's \"Knives Out\" co-star) adding another dose of female empowerment during a mission that takes Bond to Cuba.Still, \"No Time to Die\" feels as if it's working too hard to provide Craig a sendoff worthy of all the hype associated with it -- an excess that might be summed up as simply, finally, by taking too much time to reach the finish.\"No Time to Die\" premieres in US theaters on Oct. 8.

The company announced Wednesday that it made a deal to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond and one of the most iconic movie studios in Hollywood.The deal, which is valued at $8.45 billion, gives Amazon an extensive library of film and TV shows that it can use to fill out its Prime Video content coffers. MGM has a catalog with more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows, according to Mike Hopkins, who heads Prime Video and Amazon Studios.\"The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM's talented team. It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling,\" he added.CEO Jeff Bezos said that Amazon is \"really excited about MGM\" during the company's annual shareholder meeting Wednesday. Read More\"The acquisitions thesis here is really very simple: MGM has a vast, deep catalog of much beloved intellectual property,\" Bezos said, \"and with the talented people at MGM and the talented people at Amazon Studios, we can reimagine and develop that IP for the 21st century.\" The two companies said that the completion of the deal \"is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\"Even though streaming is a small part of Amazon's empire, the company has focused on becoming a more prominent player in the entertainment world as of late. For example, a highly anticipated series based on \"The Lord of the Rings\" is in the works.Prime Video \u2014 which also features original and award-winning shows such as \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" \u2014  is tied to Amazon's immensely popular Prime program, which offers faster delivery and has more than 200 million paid subscribers. Those kinds of numbers make it a competitor to the likes of Netflix (NFLX), which has 208 million subscribers.MGM and 007Although MGM's logo of a roaring lion has played in front of some of Hollywood's most beloved films, including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" it doesn't have the deep franchise bench that other studios have. So why would Amazon want MGM? Three words: Bond, James Bond.The studio owns a piece of the spy franchise, one of Hollywood's most famous film series. The Bond brand, which Eon Productions also controls, is more than a box office success story racking up billions of dollars over the past 60 years. The films and their lead character also represent a lifestyle that branches out to all parts of the globe and pop culture. If Prime Video is the new home of James Bond, that's an alluring proposition for potential consumers. Plus, \"No Time to Die,\" the latest Bond film, is set to open this October after being delayed multiple times because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Why you should care about Discovery and WarnerMedia mergingAway from the suave British spy, MGM also houses franchises including \"Rocky,\" \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" \"RoboCop,\" \"Legally Blonde\" and the Epix TV network.A consolidating media industryAnother reason Amazon would want to acquire MGM is that the media world is consolidating at a breakneck pace. To compete with Netflix and Disney (DIS), companies need scale, and buying up content, networks or studios is the best way to do that.The latest major media deal happened on Monday when AT&T announced that CNN parent company WarnerMedia would be spun off and combined with Discovery. The deal brings together a litany of brands under the Discovery and WarnerMedia banner, including Warner Bros., Discovery Channel, HBO, CNN and HGTV.Amazon acquiring MGM may not be as earth-shaking as that Discovery and WarnerMedia deal, but it's still quite notable thanks to MGM's historical prestige and Amazon's reach and resources.But the simplest reason Amazon wanted to buy MGM is that it can afford to.The hefty price tag for the acquisition is nothing of significant consequence for Amazon, one of the world's wealthiest companies. Amazon, which paid nearly $14 billion for Whole Foods in 2017, has a market cap of $1.7 trillion.Ultimately, the deal gives Amazon more content, a respected studio in Hollywood and a stylish super spy.

The question is whether Smollett will clear the invisible bar set for him to make his way back onto screens big and small or end up on a list of uncastable actors. There are indications that at least some notable figures in Hollywood have not distanced himself from Smollett, who got his start in the industry at 12 years old in a short-lived ABC's sitcom in which he starred alongside his siblings. At a hearing on Thursday, at which Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, Smollett's team presented the judge with letters of support from actor Samuel L. Jackson and his wife LaTanya, among others. Read MoreIn their letter, the couple argued that Smollett should be spared jail time and that the 39-year-old \"has already suffered a great deal of punishment as this situation has destroyed his existing career and impuned his reputation.\" Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett, arguably the most acclaimed of the family's six entertainer siblings, remains well connected and regarded in the industry, as well. Even as the family navigated Jussie Smollett's legal troubles, she was among the cast of HBO's horror drama \"Lovecraft Country,\" which debuted in 2020. (CNN, like HBO, is owned by WarnerMedia.) It was on the press tour for that series that the actress, known for her past roles on shows like WGN's \"Underground\" and HBO's \"True Blood,\" publicly opened up about her brother's scandal in detail and reiterated her support for him.Smollett was found guilty back in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime. The actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that in January 2019, two unknown men attacked him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime and at the time, celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly.  That support wavered as the incident's twists and turns played out, particularly as investigators soon determined the actor orchestrated the incident and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama \"Empire\" to stage the incident for publicity.On Thursday, the silence from some of Smollett's original defenders was deafening.Actress Yvette Nicole Brown was an exception. Among those who expressed her \"love\" for the Smollett family in 2019, Brown shared her thoughts once again on Friday, tweeting, \"The way that judge reprimanded Jussie, you'd think he murdered 2 people or used a gun instead of a taser on a Black man at a traffic stop.\" Smollett's attorneys have indicated they intend to appeal.CNN's Jason Kravarik and Brad Parks contributed to this report."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "3", "day": "16"}, "text": {"headline": "opinions", "text": "Portraying the Asian diaspora as perpetual foreigners fuels anti-Asian hate, writes Vanessa Hua.

In Toronto's Chinatown. \"Like the one we visited for Chinese New Year.\" In San Francisco, just across the bridge from where we live, we'd stocked up for the holiday, buying snacks and firecrackers that we later set off on our driveway. My sons are multiracial -- half Chinese, half Serbian and Northern European. Throughout their childhood, with varying degrees of success, I've attempted to expose them to their maternal ancestral culture and heritage, with afterschool Mandarin classes and meals at dim sum palaces.  When I was growing up in the suburbs east of San Francisco, Asian Americans rarely appeared on screen. Long Duk Dong, the dorky exchange student in the \"Sixteen Candles\" teen romance scarred a generation of us who longed for representation of a different sort. His first line -- delivered hanging upside down from a bunk bed -- \"What's happening, hot stuff?\" still rings in my ears. Back when middle school bullies tossed my shoes out the bus window, I could never have dreamed of a heroine who resembled me. Like the protagonist of \"Turning Red,\" Mei Lee, I'm also the daughter of Chinese immigrants. When I was in the eighth grade, I was also pint-sized, played the flute, studied French -- and got swept up into outsized emotions. My parents, as a term of endearment, called me \"mei mei,\" a tender nickname for \"youngest daughter.\" During our family movie night watching \"Turning Red,\" I was rapt as Mei faltered and regained herself, alternating cringing and soaring along with her as she has her first crush, goofs around with her friends, sneaks out to go to a party, and saves up for a boy band concert while still trying to honor traditions and help take care of her family's temple. One of my sons declared the film \"funny\"; the other left during the movie and read a Percy Jackson book instead. They haven't talked about it again, but I'm glad they know such a strong-willed, enterprising heroine exists. I didn't feel pandered -- panda'd? -- to, despite what a now-deleted Cinema Blend review might claim. Its critic deemed the movie \"a tad limiting in scope\" because of how deeply the story was rooted in Toronto's Asian community, and therefore risked \"alienating\" audiences.JUST WATCHED'Hating how I looked': Kyung Lah tearfully opens up about insecuritiesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Hating how I looked': Kyung Lah tearfully opens up about insecurities 01:52 I wonder who exactly this critic pictured watching the film?

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a critic's rating of 95 percent, in reviews that described it as \"heartwarming\" and \"richly layered, thematically bold.\" As I tell my creative writing students, the power of a story lies in the details, in the specifics that bring a character to life, on the page and on screen. In this way, \"Turning Red\" makes the struggles of this particular 13-year-old universal as she learns who she is and wants to be -- ultimately embracing her red panda exuberance. The Asian diaspora is not a monolith, but so often we get portrayed as all look same, all act same, all are same -- perceived as perpetual foreigners, perpetual aliens. When you deny us our stories, you deny us our humanity. Instead, the same tropes appear and reappear: Dragon Lady, submissive whore, nerd, kung fu master, or cold-hearted and calculating villain.Attacks on Asian American women are igniting a conversation about public safety No such stereotypes end up in \"Turning Red.\" The film is among the many movies and novels released in recent years that portray characters of Asian descent as fully human -- flawed, eccentric and dreaming of a bigger life -- including \"Always Be My Maybe,\" \"Tigertail,\" \"The Half of It,\" \"Interior Chinatown\" and the forthcoming \"Portrait of a Thief\" and \"Counterfeit.\" As a journalist and a novelist, I've also tried to shine a light onto untold stories that might inspire a change in thinking and a change in action. Change that we've never needed more. \"Turning Red\" was released on March 11, the second anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring Covid-19 a global pandemic. Former President Donald Trump and his associates variously dubbed the coronavirus the \"Wuhan virus,\" \"Chinese virus\" and \"Kung Flu\" -- stoking an environment where anti-Asian hate crimes rose across the country. The racist banner cry: \"Go back to where you came from!\"   From March 19, 2020, to the end of last year, 10,905 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were reported to the group Stop AAPI Hate.I can't stop thinking that I could have been Christina Yuna Lee Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of the Atlanta spa shootings, in which a White gunman killed eight people, six of them Asian American women: Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng. Justice for Asian Women is holding nationwide events to remember the victims and speak out against persistent anti-Asian hate. The violence and fear confronting Asian Americans has only grown more acute in the year since the Atlanta killings. Just last week, an attacker punched and stomped on a 67-year-old woman of Asian descent outside her building in Yonkers. We cannot let up on protesting, organizing and voting. We must continue to support victims and improve mental health services, and address systemic racism and sexism. \"Turning Red\" gives me hope, though, in its captivating challenge to stereotypes that can often lead people to view Asian Americans as \"other\" -- the first step toward targeting them.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)Which film will win the Oscar for best picture? Will Republicans trounce Democrats in the midterm elections? And what country will take home the most gold medals at the Beijing Winter Olympics?As we begin the new year, CNN Opinion has once again asked a fearless group of contributors to make predictions about some of the biggest political, cultural and sports-related moments to come. Though many of the previous year's contributors successfully predicted key political and sporting outcomes, only two correctly guessed the winners of nearly all of the entertainment questions we posed -- Raul Reyes and Holly Thomas. From predicting \"Nomadland\" would win the Oscar for best picture to betting Taylor Swift's \"Folklore\" would win the Grammy for album of the year, Reyes and Thomas proved themselves the most formidable oracles of the year. This was particularly impressive given that movie theaters and music venues remained closed for much of 2020 -- and the opportunities to see films and listen to live music were limited.Will their success last into the new year? Reyes and Thomas largely diverged on their 2022 entertainment picks. While Reyes is predicting \"West Side Story,\" Steven Spielberg's first foray into musicals, will take home the Oscar, Thomas argues the buzzworthy film \"Don't Look Up\" is better positioned for the top cinematic award. \"Anyone who's anyone in Hollywood is in it,\" she explains.Read MoreBut the most popular selection this year is \"Belfast,\" a film that chronicles the life of a working-class family in Northern Ireland in 1969. Seven of our prognosticators are betting on the film's moving narrative, compelling cinematography and young breakout star, Jude Hill.A political storm is brewingLast year, 10 out of 18 contributors correctly predicted that Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock would win their runoffs for the US Senate in Georgia. This year, 10 out of 18 of our contributors (though not the same 10) predict Democrats will suffer a crushing defeat during the 2022 midterms. If \"history is the guide here,\" writes Elliot Williams, \"it's hard to see how it's not Republicans winning control of both houses.\" Indeed, with rare exception, the party in the White House tends to lose congressional seats in the midterm elections. But other variables are compounding the Democrats' electoral problems. Growing inflation, the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and Biden's sluggish approval ratings present a perfect political storm for liberals running for reelection. Based on those factors alone, Scott Jennings concludes Republicans will \"sweep\" both the House and the Senate.Ghitis, who was among those to correctly forecast the Georgia Senate races last year, writes that while she, too, predicts Republicans will take control of both chambers, \"the margin will be minimal -- giving every member of Congress enormous power.\" And her political prognostications may be worth paying extra attention to, since Ghitis came closest to predicting Biden's approval rating at the end of 2021 -- 45%, according to CNN's poll of polls.This year, Ghitis and 11 others are predicting Biden's approval rating will hover in the 40-percentage range, as he attempts to navigate the country through the next phase of pandemic recovery. Nicole Hemmer, who predicts the President's approval rating at the end of 2022 will be 48%, says at least he will be in familiar company: \"Obama's approval was at 48% at the end of 2010, even after the shellacking he took in the midterms.\"Music that divides us, TV that unites usOur oracles are most divided on which album will win the Grammy's top prize. Many chose Olivia Rodrigo's \"Sour,\" but Lil Nas X's \"Montero\" and Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga's \"Love for Sale\" also were mentioned. Laura Coates cites her children's preference for playing Rodrigo's album nonstop, while Thomas says she was sold on \"Sour\" as soon as she heard \"Drivers License,\" the wildly popular track from Rodrigo's debut studio album.Roxanne Jones thinks \"Montero\" deserves the top prize. She writes that Lil Nas X's album is \"thought-provoking, bold and sexy. Lil Nas isn't just a champion for the LGBTQ+ community, he's a champion for the world I want to see.\" And while Jeff Yang doubts Lil Nas X will ultimately be victorious, he agrees with Jones, saying, \"No one has challenged the pop establishment more.\"Reyes says Bennett and Gaga should win. He writes the Grammys will have to recognize their \"vocal chemistry\" and award them best album as \"a sweet coda to Bennett's incredible career.\" Yang thinks Reyes may just be right -- if for no other reason than a \"sentimental\" one. For all the division over the film and music awards, there is a surprising consensus around the shows that will take the Emmys. More than three-quarters of our contributors expect \"Succession\" to win for best drama. As Ghitis explains, \"After offering the entertaining psyches of damaged souls, along with the palliative claim that the uber-rich and powerful are not really happy,\" the drama on HBO (which, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia) has got to win the top prize. Almost as many writers expect \"Ted Lasso\" to win best comedy for the second year in a row.Team America goes for the gold... againIf there is one question our oracles are good at answering, it's which country will win the most medals at the Olympics. Nearly all of 2021's contributors correctly chose the United States as the biggest winner at the Tokyo summer games. While a majority of them think the United States will once again claim the top prize at the Beijing Winter Games, Alice Stewart, who has an impressive track record of choosing sports winners, believes Norway will come first in the medal count. She writes, \"As much as I'd love to see the United States at the top, I have to go with Norway [on this one].\" Reyes argues the Scandinavian country is a \"winter sports powerhouse.\" And if there is one sport that our contributors can agree the United States will not win, it's soccer. Half of them believe Brazil will triumph at the World Cup in Qatar next November, while the rest are mostly divided between France and England. Thomas, the lone Brit among our contributors, is rooting for her own country, in part because she likes the team's manager, Gareth Southgate. She reasons, he \"has put together a brilliant group of young players, who are as lovely as the fans make them out to be... The natural next step is a World Cup win.\"There is a season for every team -- or is there?With the Major League Baseball lockout ongoing, it remains unclear if and when the 2022 season will begin. But assuming the owners and players are able to reach some sort of agreement, Alice Stewart, who successfully predicted the Atlanta Braves would win last year's World Series, believes the Houston Astros will be this year's world champion team.She is the only contributor to pick a Texas team. Paul Callan is betting the Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won the World Series in 2020, will come out on top because they \"have a solid and balanced roster ready to roll.\" Sara Stewart -- along with three others -- has her sights set on the New York Mets. She explains that \"in pro-baseball, money often buys happiness, and they just threw a whole bunch of it at pitcher Max Scherzer.\"Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAs for the NFL, nine of our contributors believe quarterback Tom Brady is unbeatable and will lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to another Super Bowl victory. As Williams puts it, \"Brady makes all of us 40-somethings look bad and will keep winning Super Bowls until he's 70.\" And while that may be a slight exaggeration, it's clear that our football oracles are looking to the past in making predictions about the future.That said, a mighty but vocal minority believes the Green Bay Packers will be the 2022 Super Bowl champions. Joey Jackson writes Aaron Rodgers, the team's quarterback, will \"redeem himself\" in February, when the big game is played, while Callan argues the Packers are \"long overdue\" for a Super Bowl win. Along came OmicronNearly two years into the pandemic, the world is still struggling to curtail the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. The recent emergence of a highly transmissible new variant -- Omicron -- has only complicated those efforts. It has also added more uncertainty to the employment market. For the final question of this year's Crystal Ball, we asked our contributors when, if at all, the US will return to pre-pandemic employment numbers. While a majority of our contributors think the US labor market will recover in 2022, there are those like Thomas who predict a recovery by July -- with one caveat. \"Even when unemployment hits pre-pandemic levels, it will probably disguise a great deal of lasting damage,\" including people in \"part-time work or low-paid work,\" she says.Meanwhile, others, like Jill Filipovic and Jones, predict that it could take until 2023 -- at the earliest -- before the labor market fully rebounds. As Jones explains, \"the country is in a different place post-pandemic,\" and it will take significantly more time before out-of-work Americans are able to rejoin some of the industries most impacted by Covid-19.

Amid this latest surge, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the group that has perhaps faced the most challenges during this pandemic -- health care workers. Now, with rising caseloads and hospitalizations, these medical professionals are being pushed to their limits once again.While many doctors and nurses are physically and emotionally exhausted, they still remain committed to treating those who seek their care. Michigan-based emergency room nurse Audrey Wendt, who recently lost her unvaccinated uncle to Covid-19, said as much in a recent Facebook post: \"My beloved community, I want YOU to know... On our backs we will carry you. No matter your beliefs, your choices, your lifestyle, your past. Our legs grow tired, and we beg for your help, but we will continue to carry you until this race is over, my friends.\"When asked if that same kindness really extended to everyone -- regardless of their politics and likely vaccination status -- Wendt, in an interview with CNN Opinion's Kirsi Goldynia, emphasized her commitment was unwavering. \"I've held so many people's hands while they are dying, and nobody's talking about who they voted for,\" she said. \"It pains me that in all of the political talk, we can't see a bigger picture here.\"As we work to turn Covid-19 from pandemic to endemic, Wendt's lesson -- about finding the humanity in one another -- is worth carrying into the new year."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "15"}, "text": {"headline": "opinions", "text": "It's vanishingly difficult for Marilyn Monroe to be seen as an actual human being.

(CNN)It's vanishingly difficult for Marilyn Monroe to be seen as an actual human being. Not after this many decades of being a symbol, a sex goddess, a blonde bombshell or a candle in the wind. As author Sarah Churchwell, whose book The Many Lives of Marilyn Monroe, has said, \"What we think about Marilyn is what we think about women.\" In the 1950s, that proved to be a damning indictment.Christina Newland Given her tragic barbiturate overdose in 1962, it's easy to dismiss Monroe as a victim without the coping mechanisms for success. But these are only partial truths at best, aided by decades of rumor, mythmaking and assumption about the woman herself.  Monroe was consistently typecast as vain and stupid for using her looks to her best advantage. She suffered sexual assault and wrote about it, though it fell more or less on deaf ears. She lived a life that was singular and extraordinary, but women continue to identify with her. While I was being interviewed for the making of this documentary, I at one point found myself unexpectedly wiping tears from my eyes as I spoke about Monroe. The feeling of kinship we feel with Monroe is, in part, what I suspect has led so many people to find her a source of continuing fascination.Read More Monroe's body, face and hair are cultural objects and commercial vehicles. She knew it back then, too. Today, they are also vessels of ideology about feminism, sex, Hollywood and #MeToo. With all of that baggage, her actual life can sometimes feel blotted out, overpowered by the force of her own star power. Even her films -- and many of them are truly great, including \"Some Like it Hot,\" \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and \"The Misfits\" -- are sometimes sidelined in favor of the screen goddess image. JUST WATCHED'In walks the most gorgeous young girl': The moment Marilyn was discoveredReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'In walks the most gorgeous young girl': The moment Marilyn was discovered 01:00 Born Norma Jean Mortenson to a single mother who was institutionalized for mental health problems, the girl who came to be known as Marilyn Monroe was raised in a series of foster homes. By the time she hustled her way to the movie backlot -- and made it into her first truly noticeable parts in a one-two punch of films in 1950 (\"Asphalt Jungle\" and \"All About Eve\") -- she had done a lot of fine-tuning.  This was not a simple and stratospheric rise, but a series of stop/start events. And the image of Monroe as a peroxide-haired bombshell did not spring forth fully formed. She was a very willing participant in the process of her star-making, from her name change to her dye job, her \"Jell-O on strings\" walk to the perhaps apocryphal story that she put marbles in the tips of her bra for added sex appeal. Monroe understood how to maximize her star potential. She worked with a personal makeup artist, Allan \"Whitey\" Snyder and agreed to a staggering range of promotional gimmicks at the behest of her studio. JUST WATCHEDHear Marilyn's response when confronted about a nude photoshoot ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear Marilyn's response when confronted about a nude photoshoot  01:02 No matter what came her way, she was canny, ambitious and self-starting: far from the \"little girl lost\" clich\u00e9 so often attached to her. In 1952 for instance, the discovery of Monroe's nude Playboy photoshoot threatened to hobble her climb to the top. The team of publicity men at 20th Century Fox insisted the photos would ruin her career, but Monroe -- wisely -- got out in front of the rumors. She openly admitted it was her and explained the reason was simply she was about to be evicted at the time and needed the money.  It was a calculated risk, and it paid off: instead of ruining her career, the scandal poured rocket fuel on it. Mid-century America was generally a socially conservative place, but the va-va-voom powers of the pinup and the bombshell during the war years likely paved the way for a more risqu\u00e9 image of American womanhood.  But Monroe's appeal was often referred to in the press with phrases that revealed the writers were usually men: things about her \"three-dimensional\" assets and her \"chassis.\" Male journalists fawned over and belittled her in equal turn, seemingly incapable of understanding her intelligence and her looks might not be mutually exclusive. It would be decades before women journalists and writers began to truly examine Marilyn and the phenomenon around her, from Joyce Carol Oates to Gloria Steinem. But at the time, Marilyn must have felt very alone. Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, once said all her talent was \"above her navel and below her belly button.\" JUST WATCHEDPhotographer: 'Follow Marilyn, and you'll get the shot'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPhotographer: 'Follow Marilyn, and you'll get the shot' 00:44 When she broke her contract with Zanuck and absconded to New York at the height of her popularity, she had grown fed up with the \"dumb blonde\" roles he'd been saddling her with. Actors had rebelled against top-down studio system control before -- Bette Davis had rebelled against the system and Olivia de Havilland won a suit against Warner Brothers in 1943, extending her contract with them continually. But taking a stand against a powerful studio was still a huge gamble, and often a tough one to win. The moguls tended to take it personally. When, in 1954, Marilyn announced the founding of Marilyn Monroe Productions, Zanuck panicked and suspended her contract, but she refused to come crawling back. Instead, she called his bluff, knowing just how popular she was with audiences, and refused to return until major changes were made to her contract with 20th Century Fox.How Marilyn took the male-led film industry and flipped it on its head  Remarkably, by 1955, she won her battle with 20th Century Fox. Fox upped her salary and offered her script, director and even cinematographer approval on each of her films with them. This was essentially unheard of for the time, proving yet again that Marilyn authored her image and her career far more than the domineering men in her life.  Maybe the turning point in our understanding of Monroe was best explained by Gloria Steinem, second-wave feminist icon and founder of Ms. Magazine. In a 1986 essay called \"The Woman Who Will Not Die.\" Steinem writes, \"Most of all, women readers mourned that Monroe had lived in an era when there were so few ways for her to know that these experiences were shared with other women, that she was not alone.\" For many women, Monroe represents a wound that never quite heals, and her quests to carve out her own identity and to be \"taken seriously\" are still a nagging thought in so many of our heads. Yet the buoyant defiance of her roles in films, like \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\" when her character says, \"I can be smart when it's important. But most men don't like it,\" provide us endless solace.

(CNN)When a movie begins by noting it is based on a true story, I instinctively wonder how Hollywood will exaggerate reality to ensure viewers are entertained. So, when a year ago papers reported that Aaron Sorkin was making a movie about the long-ago trial of the Chicago 7, I was intrigued.Daniel L. GreenbergIn 1970, two friends and I, aided by dozens of others, immersed ourselves in the transcript of that trial. Days after it ended, our efforts culminated in \"The Tales of Hoffman,\" a bestseller whose title referred to both the judge and one of the most famous defendants, Abbie Hoffman, and which reduced around 22,000 pages of the words of the trial participants into a paperback.  Now, 50 years later, I would have the opportunity to compare a movie by one of the greatest screenwriters of all time to reality. And our excitement only grew when Simon & Schuster reissued our book -- with a foreword by Sorkin -- under the title \"The Trial of the Chicago 7: The Official Transcript.\"  Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale, Ben Shenkman as Leonard Weinglass, Mark Rylance as William Kuntsler, Eddie Redmayne as Tom Hayden, and Alex Sharp as Rennie Davis in \"The Trial of the Chicago 7\"Perhaps a movie was inevitable, because the antics in the courtroom were cinematic from the start. Given that, I was not surprised that Sorkin's film, which debuted on Netflix on October 16, is terrific, with an amazing script, crisp directing and a dazzling cast.  America today confronts issues eerily similar to the late 1960s and early 1970s. An egotistical president who believes he is above the law. An attorney general wielding the Justice Department as a partisan force. Police wading into crowds of peaceful protesters, shoving, clubbing and arresting them to stifle dissent. Systemic racism targeting Black Americans. A polarized country. The question is: what has America learned, if anything, between then and now? Read MoreThe 50-year lessons America still hasn't learnedIt's a question Sorkin is also clearly asking with his varying artistic treatment of historical events in the film. What stood out most to me are its flashbacks to the streets of Chicago in August 1968, when thousands of activists gathered in Grant Park to protest the Vietnam War and the Democratic National Convention. The flashbacks include black and white footage from the 1960s as well as recreations. Scenes of Lyndon Johnson escalating the Vietnam War in archival footage, and actors playing police wading into crowds of protesters are juxtaposed against recordings of the actual police riot. This, along with representations of speeches that the defendants gave to college groups and their supporters, captures the spirit, if not always the actual words, of the defendants.Sorkin takes the greatest liberties creating a tension between his two protagonists, defendants Abbie Hoffman of the Youth International Party (Yippies) and Tom Hayden of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), magnificently played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Eddie Redmayne. Abbie is the long-haired cultural revolutionary, who dresses outlandishly and confronts authority, often with humor, arguing that a political trial demands outrageous behavior. Hayden is the opposite. Well-dressed and respectful, he fears that Hoffman's tactics will alienate the jury and jeopardize their chances to avoid prison. He instinctively rises for Judge Julius Hoffman when other defendants remain seated to protest the judge's outrageous and racist treatment of their fellow defendant, Black Panther Bobby Seale.  The Chicago Eight (who became the Chicago Seven after Bobby Seale's case was severed): Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman,Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, Bobby Seale, Lee Weiner, John Froines and David Dellinger, circa 1968. Although the reality is somewhat different -- I'll get to that in a minute -- their contrasts allow Sorkin to pose a pivotal question to the viewer as they weigh their own sympathies. Do we sit quietly in the face of repression or do we confront it head-on, violating traditional norms, even at the risk of alienating others? In Sorkin's hands, Hayden and the defendants' lead counsel, William Kunstler, eventually reluctantly embrace greater confrontation, and the finale of the movie -- spoiler averted here -- is a soaring ode to that confrontation. In reality, very little such reluctance existed. The transcript shows that on the very first day of the trial, it was Hayden -- not Hoffman -- who raised his fist to greet the jury and was admonished by the judge. Bill Kunstler never had to be convinced that this trial was political. The contrast between Hoffman and Hayden played out after the events shown in the film -- Hoffman continued to deploy humor and bombast, eventually going underground to evade a drug charge, while Hayden pursued a long career as a state legislator in California. American political activist Abbott \"Abbie\" Hoffman raises a fist from behind a bank of microphones during an unidentified rally in New York, late 1960s.As to whether Sorkin has taken liberties with the dialogue in the trial, one would be forgiven for believing the dialogue hyperbolic. One would also be wrong. From the outset, the defendants and their lawyers decided this would be no ordinary trial. Rather than sitting quietly while the prosecution presented its case, they confronted the evidence loudly, consistently and humorously.  The judge played right into their hands, constantly demeaning the defendants and their lawyers, creating reversible error at every turn. Examples abound. Some are simply petty. In the movie, the judge once or twice mispronounces the name of Bill Kunstler's co-counsel, Leonard Weinglass. In fact, he at various times called him Weinstein, Feinglass, Weinberg, Weinramer, Weinrob, Weinruss, Weingrass, Weinwer and Weinrass.   Kelvin Harrison, Jr. as Fred Hampton, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale and Mark Rylance as William Kuntsler in \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\" In perhaps the most chilling scene, Bobby Seale, the only Black defendant, is bound and gagged in front of the jury for protesting that his chosen lawyer was not present. One would be hard-pressed to believe a federal judge would do that, but Judge Hoffman did. Both in the movie and in the real courtroom. Hoffman's instructions to the marshals to take Seale into a room and \"deal with him as he should be dealt with in this circumstance\" seem too obviously villainous to be true to life. They are not; it is a verbatim quote.   What then can we learn from the trial and the era? First, no matter how powerful the forces of repression are, collective actions bear results. Demonstrations, which continued despite the kind of police abuses and selective prosecutions depicted in Sorkin's film, were instrumental in ending the Vietnam War.

Richard Nixon's obsession with winning reelection produced Watergate and his eventual downfall. Third, elections do matter, and brave senators from a president's party can effect change. When the details of Nixon's scheming were revealed in the Watergate hearings, Republicans like Barry Goldwater abandoned him and advised him to resign. Senators today might heed that lesson.Finally, and perhaps most telling, for each of us, our actions today will be studied decades from now. If we want to be on the right side of history, we should act with the integrity that allows our children and grandchildren to have pride in how we faced outrageous government behavior.

(CNN)In the latest of what seems like a steady stream of television and film reunions in the time of Covid, the well-preserved cast of the beloved political drama \"The West Wing\" came together Thursday for a staged reading of one of the show creator Aaron Sorkin's favorite episodes: \"Hartsfield's Landing,\" the 14th episode of the show's third season (of seven, for those who may have watched occasionally but failed to stick it out to the bitter end) which originally aired in 2002. Jeff Yang The episode depicts foreboding tension between the US and China, set against the backdrop of White House senior staff tensely awaiting the voting tallies of a tiny New Hampshire town whose dozens of residents vote at 12:01 a.m., well before the rest of the state (modeled on real hamlets in the state like Dixville Notch). The performers weren't doing it just for kicks, though they did seem to get a kick out of re-embodying the roles they'd made iconic, displaying an easy camaraderie and a deftly familiar mastery of the dialogue quirks and character eccentricities we've since come to call \"Sorkinesque.\" No, they'd reunited with the purpose of supporting When We All Vote, the nonpartisan organization founded by Michelle Obama, with the purpose of encouraging electoral participation particularly among groups with significant undervotes, such as youth and communities of color.  It's a tremendously worthy cause. The event -- streamed on HBO Max (HBO is a sister company of CNN under the ownership of WarnerMedia) -- was a generous donation of time and the precious commodity of celebrity. And for those who were young, scrappy and hungry back when \"The West Wing\" was at peak relevance, it was likely a blissful injection of high-minded liberal nostalgia directly into the femoral artery. Bradley Whitford and Allison Janney in 'A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote.'But if it was tacitly intended as a motivational reminder of better days, days when we had Presidents Who Acted Like Presidents, I can't be the only one for whom the performance had the opposite effect. Because by making a direct appeal to fans of an earlier (and fictional) presidential era, the actors and creators pulled an anodyne scrim across what's happening in today's White House.Read MoreWe're in a time of unrelenting urgency, a rolling catastrophe in which every day seems to bring us new examples of presidential bombast, cruelty or alleged malfeasance; where the pillars of our democracy themselves are threatened at every turn; where the four horsemen -- War, Pestilence, Famine and Death -- seem to be  just one step away from gleefully playing polo on the White House lawn.Which means that even as someone who enjoyed \"The West Wing\" in the early 2000s, I found myself tooth-grindingly annoyed Thursday  at all of the purposefully droll \"business\" occupying most of the episode: Deputy chief of staff Josh (Bradley Whitford) obsesses over the electoral outcome of the fictional early-voting 42-person hamlet of Hartsfield's Landing. Press secretary C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) and POTUS bodyman Charlie Young (Dul\u00e9 Hill) engage in a dubious duel of escalating pranks. President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen) plays chess with senior aides Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) and Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff) -- all of this taking place under the looming shadow of a potential hot war with China over Taiwan, which exactly one staffer seems to be taking seriously: Chief of Staff Leo McGarry (played by Sterling K. Brown, filling in for the late John Spencer).  'The West Wing's' idealism looks even better 20 years after its first EmmyThe characteristically Sorkin tics of \"The West Wing\" characters -- rapid-fire dialogue, self-deprecating humor and an oversaturation of wit -- are meant to humanize them. As Sorkin himself made clear in an interview with The New York Times back in March, he isn't \"drawn to either Machiavellianism or dolts. I like those heroes without capes\" -- preferring to present the White House as just an \"interesting, glamorous workplace where almost anything can happen in the course of a day,\" rather than the control panel for the world's largest economy and most powerful military. That's why in \"The West Wing,\" the equivalent of a coworker accidentally eating the donut you'd been saving in the office breakroom gets as much -- or more -- screen time as a potential geopolitical conflict that could cascade into World War III and erase millions of lives.  But from the vantage point of today, \"humanize\" reads a lot like \"normalize,\" and we've gotten desperately tired of attempts to normalize what is decidedly not normal. Yes, it's certainly fun dipping back into the vintage milieu of a more innocent time, but Bradley Whitford, out of character, jokingly admitted something close to the truth in his introductory remarks before the performance: \"We went to When We All Vote and said, 'You guys are a great organization, helping to get out the vote, combat voter suppression -- what can we, the People's Choice Award nominated cast of the West Wing do to help? They thought about it a moment and said, 'Nothing. You have no skills or experience that can help us in any way.

I've been wondering for at least half my life how necessary they are to movies and television, given the many critics' awards that have more provocatively set an advance agenda for the Oscars. The question is additionally complicated by the fact that this year, as co-hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler noted in their opening monologue, nobody is altogether sure what the difference is between a movie made for television and a movie shown on television but was meant to be shown in theaters that are mostly closed to the public because of the pandemic. The distinction still wasn't clear after three hours and change of an unavoidably patchwork live television show that tried its best to work around the Covid-19 protocols and still make everything seem as glitzy and funny and campy as preceding Globes ceremonies. One suspects the distinctions will continue to be unclear by the time the Academy Awards take place on April 25, however things will be for the rest of the world by then. Golden Globes 2021 fashion: 'Hybrid' ceremony combines red carpet with bold at-home looksThe Globes are always a little weird and awkward to watch, given their history of -- putting it diplomatically -- loopy spontaneity from presenters and recipients. They felt more so this year, given that the nominees were all at home with loved ones or, in Bill Murray's case, in a sunny backyard (he rocked that Hawaiian shirt, by the way, but still didn't win for best supporting actor in \"On the Rocks\"). As welcome as the virtual audience was made to feel in their homes, especially since so many of them got dressed up for the occasion, it at times felt as though we were intruding spectators. But still, not as intrusive as the music trying to \"play\" people off their overlong acceptance speeches as if they were onstage as usual. I mean ... they're at home, OK? Tell the affiliates to cut some slack. Despite the strained circumstances, the co-hosts did fine, game work as they were in ballrooms at opposite ends of the continent -- Fey in New York, Poehler in Hollywood -- addressing an audience comprised of first responders and essential workers who, by the way, did their part to replicate past Globes telecasts by getting noticeably rowdier as the evening went on. The Fey-Poehler tandem also showed this wasn't their first Globe rodeo by taunting the HFPA as a bunch of random nobodies and making sidelong references to a Los Angeles Times report that its 87-member roster does not include a single Black member. (A group of HFPA members, including its president Helen Hoehne of Germany and former president Meher Tatna of India appeared onstage to say, essentially, that they will do better. \"We must ensure,\" Tatna said, \"that everybody gets a seat at our table.\")The 78th Golden Globes address controversy, amid a glitchy telecast where streaming reigns supremeJane Fonda, winner of the HFPA's Cecil B. DeMille Award, did a far better job of articulating this imperative, not just with the Globes, but the rest of show business. \"There's a story we've been really afraid to see and hear about ourselves and this industry. The story about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out.\" She urged \"this industry\" to \"expand that tent so that everyone rises, and everyone's story has a chance to be seen and heard.\" Most of the first wave of awards seemed to reflect this attitude as Black British actors Daniel Kaluuya and John Boyega collected supporting actor Globes in movies (Kaluuya for \"Judas and the Black Messiah\") and television (Boyega for \"Small Axe\"). African American screenwriter Kemp Powers shared best animated feature honors with director Pete Docter for \"Soul.\" The historic presence of three women nominated for best motion picture director was acknowledged and applauded. One of those three, Chinese-born Chlo\u00e9 Zhao won for \"Nomadland,\" which was also the winner for best motion picture drama.

View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Of all the made-up holidays that sitcoms have graced us with \u2014 Friendsgiving, Festivus, Chrismukkah \u2014 none is more wholesome or more necessary than Galentine's Day. Leslie Knope, the main character of the NBC show Parks and Recreation, explained the holiday to the world this way: \"Every February 13, my lady-friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies.\" Galentine's Day emerged as a less-debauched alternative to the more traditional ladies' night out (though a mimosa-fueled brunch can leave participants as sozzled as a night spent bar-hopping). And just as Galentine's Day has become a holiday not only about female friendship but feminism, so too did the rising popularity of ladies' nights become a central part of the debate about feminism in the 1970s and 1980s. And the core of that debate took place at the most unexpected of places: Chippendales.  Yes, that Chippendales. The male dance revue where men stripped down to padded thongs while throngs of women gasped and ogled and cheered. Founded in 1979 by Steve Banerjee, an Indian immigrant attempting to turn his run-down nightclub into a star-studded must-visit venue, Chippendales arrived on the scene after a decade of feminist activism was beginning to hit a wall. As the effort to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment stalled in the states, Chippendales offered a new version of women's equality: the right of women to lust after scantily clad men. Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope in \"Parks and Recreation\" That, anyway, was the sales pitch: that women could turn the table on men by coming down to the club on the west side of L.A. to watch them strip. That it would be empowering. Liberating. And while that peering-at-pecs-as-praxis may seem eye-rolling today, one feminist saw Chippendales as an opportunity to press the case for equality.  In 1980, Gloria Allred, who at the time was president of the Women's Equal Rights and Legal Defense Fund, sparked controversy when she chose to hold a fundraiser for the group at the LA club. She treated it as a lark, a way to raise money, generate press and have a laugh. \"Feminists are always accused of having no sense of humor,\" she told the Los Angeles Times. \"Well, we do, and we think it will be fun.\" Banerjee, always eager to court press attention for the club, also pushed the feminist line. Watching men strip down to their thongs was, he insisted, \"a very, very liberated thing to do.\" Read MoreA show by the Chippendales in New York City, 14th April 1984.The funds for the performance went to a noble enough cause -- teaching women how to secure alimony and child support payments without the expense of hiring a lawyer -- but not everyone was convinced that Allred was furthering the feminist cause. Calling it \"demeaning\" and \"objectification,\" a number of feminists held that Chippendales not only contributed to the exploitation of bodies, but downplayed the far more vulnerable position of women who engaged in sex work.  Allred seemed to understand that as well. While women were often limited to low-wage jobs, she acknowledged, \"With men it's different. They have access to every other occupation in life. If they're stripping, it's generally a matter of choice, rather than of economic necessity.\" In order to argue she wasn't engaged in exploitation -- the men didn't have to be there -- she had to admit that she wasn't really turning the tables -- as she implicitly acknowledged, women didn't have that power. As if to underscore that point, during the event one of the male dancers approached Allred and flipped up her skirt, making it clear that even if he was the one stripped down to his underwear, he could turn the tables right back around on her. A scene from \"Sex And The City\" (\"The Caste System\" episode). Allred wasn't able to turn Chippendales into a feminist paradise (in fact, she would later sue the club for discrimination, arguing that by not allowing men in as patrons, it was engaged in sex discrimination). Nor was Banerjee, who was more invested in making himself and his male partners wealthy through the club, and assorted criminal activities, than creating a place where women felt safe and empowered. But one group of people did find a way to turn the club into a place of friendship and feminism: the women patrons themselves. At least for some women, Chippendales served as a place where they could bond with other women without being hit on by men, a slice of women's-only nightlife that could rarely be found elsewhere in the city (though Chippendales did open its doors to men after the last pair of tear-away pants had been shed). As Candace Mayeron, a Chippendales' associate producer in the 1980s told us for the podcast \"Welcome to Your Fantasy,\" which delves into the history of the Chippendales, women at the club confided they found it a \"safe, insulated environment.\" Why you need a 'big friendship' in your life Even though these off-stage bonding moments were largely hidden from public view, Chippendales had a real impact on rituals of female friendship. It played a role in transforming bachelorette parties from at-home gift extravaganzas to the night-on-the-town debauchery that gained popularity in the 1980s, and has expanded into the full-blown bachelorette weekend at destinations like Las Vegas and Nashville. By the 1990s, though, men in Spandex grinding on stage were no longer the center of conversations about women, sex and friendship. They'd been replaced by women in Jimmy Choos downing cosmos, as \"Sex and the City\" offered the same thrill of sex and mostly naked men but placed far more focus on the way friendships could serve as the primary relationship in women's lives. Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookThat show, which centered on well-off White women cloistered in New York City, offered at best a limited kind of feminism -- the show ends with most of the main characters devoting themselves to their romantic relationships. But in more recent years, female friendship has moved to center stage. Last year, Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman, hosts of the \"Call Your Girlfriend\" podcast, published the book \"Big Friendship,\" an exploration of female friendship that argues friendships need just as much care and maintenance as romantic relationships, and should be valued at least as much. And that's a feminist argument: dethroning the notion that heterosexual romantic relationships should be the center of women's lives. It's that same ethos that fuels Galentine's Day. So, was Chippendales feminist? I've spent two years studying it and I'm still not convinced. It was a deeply heteronormative and even at times misogynistic place. But women did find some solidarity in their experience at Chippendales.

Americans are collectively hitting the pandemic wall and just endured the terrifying and deflating impeachment trial, while residents of multiple states are facing spine-cracking temperatures and ravaging winter storms.  Sara Stewart But there's a bright light in all this darkness: \"Ted Lasso.\" Flip it on and, like one of those light-therapy sun lamps, feel your winter angst melting away.  The Apple TV sitcom, which arrived last summer, is a mental health stealth bomb. Dressed up as a sports comedy, it espouses a philosophy that's hilariously antithetical to that genre: The notion that being a decent person, and treating other people with respect, is more important than who scored the most goals. The show, created by star Jason Sudeikis, along with Bill Lawrence, Joe Kelly and Brendan Hunt, features a small-time football coach who -- despite having no experience with the sport -- gets hired to coach a professional soccer team in England.\"Ted Lasso\" came out with relatively minimal fanfare in August. It picked up steam a couple of months later, as word of mouth began to spread. That talk has continued apace, turning the show into a sleeper hit a la \"Schitt's Creek.\" (A quick Twitter search yields countless viewers either stunned by how much they loved it or bemoaning the long wait until a second season.) Its recent Golden Globe, Critics Choice, Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild nominations don't hurt either.  The three subversive messages of 'Schitt's Creek'If you, like me, are finding this February hard to take, I implore you to give \"Ted Lasso\" a try, even if it means subscribing to one more damned app.Read MoreLike \"Schitt's Creek,\" the series is sort of a slow burn. I started off expecting the Sudeikis character from a 2013 NBC ad campaign to promote its broadcast of Premier League games. In the four-minute spot, the comic is a cocky, clueless American football coach who (like in the series) is inexplicably hired to head a British soccer team. His struggle to understand the rules made the spot a globally viral sensation. You'd be forgiven for anticipating a mildly amusing if probably too-long version of that gag. Instead, each episode of \"Ted Lasso\" feels like a heartwarming British indie, like \"The Full Monty\" or \"Blinded By the Light\" (albeit with glaring Apple product placement). Each member of its ensemble cast gets their own moments to shine, and there's nary a truly unlikeable character - with the exception of the team owner's rarely seen ex-husband, a sneering mogul played by Anthony Head. And even he seems to hold potential for some kind of redemption in season two. Cristo Fernandez in \"Ted Lasso,\" now streaming on Apple TV+.\u200b\nTed still doesn't have much of a handle on soccer, but he's learning, and seemingly unfazed by the locals' vulgar nickname for him. He brims with positivity, optimism and Dad jokes (\"Do you believe in ghosts?\" the team owner asks Lasso. \"I do,\" he says, \"but more importantly, I believe they need to believe in themselves.\") The easily recognizable types around him -- an arrogant team superstar and his model girlfriend, the hotheaded captain, Ted's chilly boss, her bumbling aide -- are all revealed to be more nuanced than you'd think. Ted's journey is a comedy, sure, but it also unexpectedly leans into feelings. All the feelings. Bet you tear up at least once. Some initial reviewers, prepared for more of a straight-up sitcom, grumbled about the show's lack of laughs per minute. One dismissed it as \"determinedly cornball\" and gave an eye roll to its being about \"just a nice guy whose life is complicated by an embittered, scheming woman (the club owner) and a wishy-washy, unappreciative woman (his wife).\" What that reviewer fails to acknowledge is that neither of these women (played by Hannah Waddingham and Andrea Anders, respectively) are painted as antagonists. Each is coping with real pain, which is something Sudeikis' character seems to understand, and empathize with, more than this critic does.  America isn't ready for the coming wave of grief Hunt, one of Sudeikis's co-creators, plays his sidekick, the laconic Coach Beard. The two actors are friends from their early improv days, and gave some surprising insight into the show's origins when they talked to Brene Brown, self-help author and \"Ted Lasso\" superfan, on her podcast. The comics both cut their teeth at Amsterdam's Boom Chicago, and Hunt spoke about \"Ted Lasso\" being infused with the spirit of Gezelligheid -- an untranslatable Dutch term with myriad meanings, one of them being, Hunt said, \"don't be a bummer to each other.\"  While the character of Ted presents as unapologetically square, his origins are a little trippy: the show, Sudeikis has said, \"grew from conversations he and Hunt had walking the streets of Amsterdam on mushrooms.\" The experience stuck with Sudeikis, who name-checked the Michael Pollan book \"How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence\" on Brown's podcast. He and Hunt started writing the pilot shortly after Pollan's book came out. \"Ted is, in a ... way, like mushrooms,\" said Sudeikis. \"He is egoless.\" The duo likes to think of Ted as a connector of those around him, a facilitator for better relationships. How timely and delightful that, as the world of medicine debates making psychedelics legal treatment for trauma, depression and anxiety (challenges with which so many of us are now struggling to cope), Ted turns out to be a therapeutic drug in sitcom form.

That frisson of faith in humanity. Feels radical, doesn't it?  I'm not saying it's realistic, or even advisable, to \"be like a goldfish\" with a seconds-long memory, as Ted likes to advise, and forget all of the toxicity in our culture. But \"Ted Lasso\" offers a window of possibility that we might learn to incrementally become more forgiving of others -- and of ourselves. Now, more than ever, Americans need a big dose of Gezelligheid.

(CNN)NOTE: The article below contains spoilers for \"Me You Madness.\"It's hardly shocking that Louise Linton, wife of ultrawealthy former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, chose Valentine's Day weekend as the perfect date to release her feature film \"Me You Madness,\" a special gift to the person she loves most: Herself. Jeff Yang \"Me You Madness\" bills itself as a dark comedy, but Linton seems to be the only one in on the joke -- it's hard to imagine anyone watching this serial murder celebration and laughing, other than its writer/director/producer.  But that probably won't bother Linton, who has crafted a career as a kind of performance artist of self-indulgence: The daughter of a wealthy Scottish developer, she burst into the public spotlight in 2016 after self-publishing \"In Congo's Shadow,\" her memoir of a college gap year in Zambia, which she described in its Amazon synopsis as the \"compelling coming-of-age story\" of \"a 'skinny white muzungu with long angel hair'\" who travels to \"darkest Africa\" and \"learns that friendship can transcend race, age, and history.\" The book's handful of readers pointed out its blanket factual inaccuracies and condescending, White-savior tone, and it went viral as a diamond-dusted example of staggering privilege, until Linton finally pulled it from virtual shelves.Louise Linton and Steve MnuchinStories like this flare up and fade away just as quickly, and Linton's likely would have as well, if it hadn't been for her marriage to Mnuchin, and Mnuchin's subsequent appointment by ex-President Donald Trump as secretary of the Treasury immediately thereafter.  Read MoreFrom there, Linton stumbled through a series of \"Let them eat cake\" controversies, including Instagramming a photo of herself returning from a trip to Fort Knox tagged with an array of luxury items in her wardrobe, and posing gleefully with Mnuchin holding a freshly printed sheet of uncut currency. But now, with the release of \"Me You Madness\" -- a product of her personal production company Stormchaser Films -- it has become a lot less clear whether these entitlement eruptions were accidental, or merely early guerrilla marketing for this incredibly bizarre vanity project. JUST WATCHEDMnuchin's wife says she's 'super duper' sorryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMnuchin's wife says she's 'super duper' sorry 02:09Since the trailer was released a few weeks ago, Linton has been actively promoting the film as a satirical combination of wry mea culpa and clap back at her critics. Having expended several regretful hours watching it, it's clear that it's both of these, and neither.  Spoiler warning, for anyone who thinks this movie could possibly be spoiled further: The film focuses on Catherine Black, played by Linton as a kind of neon cartoon of herself (or, she might argue, how she's been falsely depicted in the news): Catherine is a narcissistic conspicuous consumer of both material possessions and men, in the latter case, quite literally -- she has a freezer full of severed male body parts, which she and her Chinese BFF/accomplice/female sex toy Yu Yan (Taiwanese American actress Shuya Chang) gleefully dine on in gourmet meals prepared, naturally, by Catherine herself. Things get complicated when Tyler, a hunky would-be thief played by British actor Ed Westwick, enters the picture -- with a dubious blue-collar American accent. Ed Westwick and Louise Linton in 'Me You Madness' Much of the unhinged remainder of the film is alluded to in the trailer: Catherine and Tyler have sex, fight, have more sex, brandish various weapons -- in one already-infamous scene Catherine whirls nunchucks while explaining that they're \"cool\" because Bruce Lee used them, and Bruce Lee is cool -- but everything ends happily in the end, as Tyler ends up embracing Catherine's way of life, making the threesome with Yu Yan permanent (they celebrate with a vegan dinner, with the clumsy joke being that the dinner is in fact a vegan) and then turning it into a quartet with the credit-sequence arrival of Tyler and Catherine's cutie-patootie baby. It's hardly new stuff, even as a shock-tactic black comedy. Murder and cannibalism as a comic metaphor goes back to Jonathan Swift's modest proposal, and has remained a popular concept ever since, in musicals like \"Sweeney Todd,\" movies like \"Delicatessen,\" \"Eating Raoul,\" \"The Cook, The Wife, The Thief and His Lover\" and entire franchises like the vast canon of Hannibal Lecter. Ed Westwick (back to camera) and Louise Linton in 'Me You Madness'Sometimes it's the rich eating the poor. Sometimes it's the poor eating the rich. Sometimes it's the interesting eating the boring, or the sophisticated eating the crude. \"Me You Madness\" purports to focus on gender, with a very specific pop culture antecedent -- which is even noted in one of the movie's many fourth-wall breaking moments, as Catherine says that \"If you're thinking this is a straight rip-off of 'American Psycho,' in some ways you may be right. But this is a woman's tale.\" (In one early scene, Catherine publicly eviscerates a chubby loser on her hedge-fund team -- figuratively, in this case -- whose name turns out to be Patrick, undoubtedly a reference to \"American Psycho\" protagonist Patrick Bateman. The point being perhaps that Catherine, the movie's Batewoman, outmans Bateman.)So this is Linton's ultimate girlboss movie, her paean to independent womanhood, or something.  But if Linton's claims of telling a \"woman's tale\" are made questionable by her unique privilege, her assertion that her \"inclusive\" team seeks to \"celebrate diversity\" (as she said in a statement to the Hollywood Reporter) is simply laughable: Linton has apparently learned nothing from the backlash after her 2016 book release. Linton's clueless post has a dark side Every major speaking role in \"Me You Madness\" is White (the only Black thing in the movie is Catherine's last name, though it's an act of mercy to Black actors that they were excused from this fiasco), with two prominent exceptions: Catherine's sister man-eater Yu Yan, and a Vietnamese male manicurist named Tien, played by Jimmy Dinh.  Yu Yan is relegated to speaking exclusively in Mandarin and letting her body talk, in scenes as Catherine and Tyler's bedroom third wheel; she's solely there to express her enthusiasm for man-flesh, both living and dead. Tien's dialogue is similarly all in Vietnamese; his only role in the movie is to cringe when Catherine accuses him of doing a bad gel job and to give her the excuse for comic exposition over why working-class himbo Tyler is lying unconscious in her palatial house.  Despite Linton's vast privilege, she's continuously positioned herself as both an excluded outsider and a victim of the \"woke mob.\" She told Fox News, \"When I was in my early 20s, I definitely felt like it was a boys club, and I felt like people didn't take me seriously because I was trying to produce as young as 25\"; the fact that very few people are able to produce films at twice that age doesn't seem to register for her. In a softball profile for The New York Times, she said that while Mnuchin was in office, she \"felt censored\" and didn't know what she was \"allowed to be\" due to social media pressures. Perhaps in her mind, angry tweets create a cage as oppressive and confining as the ones the Trump administration used to store the children of migrants.

The madness is that, in a time when tens of millions are out of work and hundreds of thousands have died, the Trump administration's aristocracy are not only paying no price for the ruin they've visited on America -- they're giving themselves over-the-top consolation prizes for the trauma they believe they experienced.

View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)There's a scene in the film \"The Sound Of Music\" when Captain von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, emerges from a heated standoff with the governess Maria, an effervescent Julie Andrews, to hear voices down the hall. Holly ThomasFollowing the sound, the captain reaches the door of a room, inside which his seven children are standing, dripping wet (they had fallen out of rowboat earlier) and singing. Caught off guard, the captain watches them for a few seconds, before stepping inside to join in. Nervous, the children stop to listen, before they all finish the song together. The captain then hugs them all, while Maria watches from outside, spellbound. As she turns to leave, the captain rushes out to stop her. Within about two minutes, Plummer captures rage, surprise, tenderness, warmth, humor, and then contrition. Also, he's wearing a pale gray suit. If by some accident you've never seen the film before, approach this scene with caution: it has awesome power. Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Captain von Trapp was so impeccable, and \"The Sound Of Music\" so wildly successful, that had he halted his acting career in 1965 immediately after the film's release, his legacy would already have been secure. Instead, the beloved Canadian actor, who died this past week aged 91, threw himself into a diverse and challenging career on both stage and screen, distinguishing himself as among the greatest actors of his generation, but also as one who palpably enjoyed every minute of his work.Though Plummer had reservations about the role as the captain, even kicking up a fuss until there was a little more \"edge\" injected into the character, his sense of fun was evident on the set of \"The Sound Of Music.\" He and Julie Andrews were so unable to stop laughing during the shooting of the romantic gazebo scene that they inspired director Robert Wise's decision to shoot it in silhouette, to better mask the actors' giggles. Budweiser's very smart Super Bowl callRead MoreUnsure of his dancing abilities, Plummer showed up to rehearse for the ballroom scene wearing tights - looking as he put it, \"like one of those Albanian vampires.\" He credited Andrews with \"carrying him through\" the dance, joking in an interview for the film's 40th anniversary: \"I'd already fallen in love with myself in my tights earlier, but I forgot about that when you came on.\" While off-set, Plummer caught rehearsals for performances at Mozart's house, entertained the cast with piano recitals (Julie Andrews remembers him being able to perform Rachmaninoff by ear), and, in his words, got \"soused.\" This appears to have been a theme during his career - asked by Conan O'Brien in 2015 how he'd managed to stay in such great shape, Plummer credited a \"long life of hard drinking,\" and admitted it had been a \"very relaxed\" life. His ease under pressure was perhaps one of his great gifts as a stage actor - he won a Tony award in 1973 for the title role in the musical \"Cyrano,\" and another in 1997 for the title role in \"Barrymore,\" about the Shakespearean actor John Barrymore. Later on, character parts in films like \"Return of the Pink Panther,\" released in 1975, were an outlet for Plummer's wonderful sense of humor, while roles like that of Rudyard Kipling in \"The Man Who Would be King,\" which came out in the same year, underscored his ability to hold his own against bankable stars like Michael Caine and Sean Connery.  In 2010, he received his first Oscar nomination for \"The Last Station,\" in which he played Leo Tolstoy opposite Helen Mirren. Two years later, at the age of 82, he took home the gong for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Mike Mills' \"Beginners,\" playing a father who finally comes out as gay following the death of his wife. He was - and remains - the oldest winner of an Academy Award for acting. Americans are wondering: Will I get the vaccine or the virus first?In 2018, Plummer received another nomination for \"All The Money In The World\" - an especially impressive feat given that he had shot all his scenes in nine days, having replaced Kevin Spacey in the role of J. Paul Getty (who Plummer had met at a \"couple parties\" decades before). So eager was Plummer to work with director Ridley Scott that he abandoned a holiday to take the part - and so secure was he in his ability to master the role that he declined to watch any of Spacey's footage. His outlook on the situation was impressively positive under the circumstances - by the time allegations of Spacey's sexual misconduct had emerged, the film was already in the can - and in Scott's words, \"kind of perfect.\" Undeterred, Plummer threw himself into what he described as \"a scary and fun experience,\" calling the whole thing an \"absolute wonderful, rosy pleasure.\"It's easy, not to mention tempting, to allow people who have portrayed heroes on-screen to remain frozen in time and fiction, never allowing them to grow old, or become real. But Christopher Plummer's transcendence beyond his most famous role only saw him grow more likeable, and his abundant gifts flourish.

Describing in 2015 his regret at turning down the role of Gandalf in Peter Jackson's \"The Lord Of The Rings\" series, he conceded (perhaps unfairly to himself) that he may have been too \"a little cold and imperious\" as the wizard, whereas Ian McKellen, who accepted the role, was \"warm and...

Sherrilyn IfillMany of us were introduced to her when we were at the age where girls often feel ugly, awkward, self-critical. For brown-skinned Black girls in the 1970s, the African-ness of our looks left our beauty, or even our aspirations to beauty, in debate. The color of our skin, our broad noses, the texture of our hair -- despite the strong \"Black is Beautiful\" moment -- were not the standard of beauty presented on television, where we saw ourselves only rarely in prominent roles, especially in the ubiquitous television movies of the time. Enter Cicely Tyson -- a brilliant actress, luminous beauty and unapologetically Black actress of such exceptional talent that she changed the game. In her powerful television portrayals in \"Roots,\" in the \"Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" we saw someone who looked like women in our families.She wore her hair natural and in braids. She was thin and not voluptuous. Most important for me was that in every frame in which her face was on the screen it was clear that she, as the character, was...thinking. Whoever she portrayed had ideas, feelings, plans and dreams. She could convey this with just one look. And this was as important as her physical beauty. An actress who looked like us and who could demonstrate in her performances the existence of the rich interior life of Black women was, in those days, and frankly still in these days, a powerful source of affirmation -- a display of our humanity for all to see.Read MoreMs. Tyson's presentation of loving romantic relationships between Black women and men was also a revelation and even transgressive for the television screen in the '70s. Among these was her turn as Jane Pittman in \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" based on the bestselling novel by Ernest Gaines. Her performance is an acting tour de force as she transforms from a young girl freed from slavery in the 1860s to a centenarian in the early days of the 20th century civil rights movement.  Watching this film on television as a girl, I was especially riveted by the scene in which the elderly Miss Pittman reflects on the brief period in which she was joined with the love of her life, her late husband Joe Pittman. The story of these young lovers is beautiful, complex and ultimately tragic. Cloris Leachman's secret gift When the story concludes, 110-year-old Jane explains that although she has been involved with other men since her husband's death, none could ever touch the depth of her love for Joe. It is a moment both devastating and beautiful. In the elderly Jane, we are called to see the depth of experience, love, loss and dreams that are in the eyes of every elderly Black woman, if we choose to see. Jane Pittman is a woman, with a woman's dreams and longing and tragedy and history. Her love for Joe Pittman is deep and abiding, and Ms. Tyson's portrayal of Miss Pittman's buried pain is a deliberate presentation of the complexity and breadth of Black love and Black womanhood.  Ms. Tyson did the same in the film \"Sounder.\" It is about a family, about a young boy whose father, Nathan Lee, is imprisoned after stealing food, and about a strong, resilient mother, Rebecca, who is determined to keep her family going as they wait for her husband's return. But at the center of this movie is one of the most sensitive, radiant depictions of Black love ever filmed: Ms. Tyson's face, for example, when she spies her husband in the distance, newly freed and returning home, and sprints with headlong abandon from her porch and across her land to greet him.

There's a victory in that as well. The lives of Black women are so often cut short. Breast cancer, ovarian cancer, heart disease -- so many of us have lost our mothers and grandmothers too young to the health crises that are disproportionately experienced by Black women. But Cicely Tyson lived almost as long as the fictional Jane Pittman. And she was beautiful, radiant and impeccably dressed to the end. She also continued performing. Indeed, her triumphant turn on Broadway in 2013's \"The Trip to Bountiful\" at the age of 88 is regarded as one of her most extraordinary performances and earned her a Tony Award.A legend has left us.

Absolutely. One of the all-time greats. Those aforementioned characters -- her best-known handful of roles -- only hint at the unfettered range and sustained quality of Leachman's body of work in over a half-century of more than 200 credits on big and small screens. The size of the role didn't seem to matter, nor did the age or deportment of the character involved. She seemed, literally, up for anything and everything. Her credits throughout the early TV of the 1950s and 1960s are like a mini history of the medium, with shows like \"Bob and Ray,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Rawhide,\" \"Route 66,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"The Donna Reed Show,\" \"Dr. Kildare\" and \"The Twilight Zone,\" where she's best remembered from the 1961 episode \"It's a Good Life,\" where she's the tightly wound mother of Billy Mumy's apocalyptically moody little boy, roles both of them would repeat in a 2003 \"Twilight Zone\" sequel.

I digress. By now you're probably saying: Big deal. It just proves she was busy. Lots of character actors make themselves familiar to the public just because they're always around. Where's the greatness in that? Let's go back to Phyllis Lindstrom. If you were a regular viewer of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" you remember her, along with anchorman Ted Baxter and Sue Ann Nivens (played by Betty White), the Happy Homemaker, as one of the three most overbearing and clueless people in Mary Richards's orbit. Yet, one of the abiding graces of that groundbreaking, much-honored sitcom was its insistence that even obnoxious jerks are human beings, too. And when the show gave Leachman room to pull back the curtain on her character's deep wounds and insecurities, she let us see Phyllis's scars -- without pathos and with all the uproarious, shrewdly observed wit still humming along. Such delicate, impeccably wrought craftsmanship won her two best-supporting comedy actress Emmys. And even as she was curating Phyllis every week and simultaneously collecting paychecks, credits and still more awards, she managed to bring forth her most indelible big-screen triumph: an Oscar-winning performance as Ruth Popper in 1971's \"The Last Picture Show.\" Ruth was the sad, neglected wife of the high school football coach in a smaller Texas town that's withering away as precipitously as she is. Her affair with Sonny, a high school senior played by Timothy Bottoms, restores hope and even vivacity to her features. But Sonny abandons her for the school's prettiest girl, Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), with whom he elopes in a brief, doomed marriage.

Leachman creates a zone of wild-eyed tension as her character can barely contain her rage, resentment and deep hurt. Her anger subsides when she sees her chastened lover's desolation as being in sync with her own and, ever so gradually and persuasively, forgives him. Acting like this can make an abandoned forest cry, while making the bluntest, most forsaken object seem human. That's what makes it great.

As the hashtag #CatsMovie trended worldwide, Twitter exploded with phrases like \"creepy and weird,\" \"car crash\" and \"nightmare fuel.\"  It's a case of the arts ignoring science: There's a very real psychological phenomenon behind the horrified reactions, which director Tom Hooper might well have researched before embracing the film's admittedly bizarre creative choices.Jeff Yang Rather than taking the stage version's path of using makeup and costumes to turn actors into figurative felines, Hooper decided to use \"digital fur technology\" to fluff out stars like Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, James Corden and, yes, Taylor Swift with catlike bodies while leaving their faces largely human. The resulting hybrids have ears and swishing tails but human hands and feet -- and, as many pointed out, jiggly human d\u00e9colletage.Add the fact that some of the cat-things wear clothing and shoes -- and others are resplendent in sleek bare fur -- and some odd inconsistencies with scale, and it's all a bit much for aficionados of the Andrew Lloyd Webber original (and even for some members of the subculture of anthropomorphic-animal enthusiasts known as \"furries.\").If \"Cats\" didn't want to go with humans in makeup, it could've pounced in the other direction, toward the hyper-realist animal animation of Disney's recently released \"The Lion King\" remake, which, despite its own detractors, certainly managed to prove that authentic-looking cats can sing and dance.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDCreeped out by robots? This might be whyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCreeped out by robots? This might be why 02:35 But the in-betweenness of the cats of \"Cats\" is deeply disconcerting, because it causes them to roam in the shadows of a phenomenon called the uncanny valley. First described by Japanese roboticist Masahiro Masi in 1970, it is defined as a level of semi-realistic human appearance in nonhuman things that triggers instinctive terror or visceral disgust.That's because when something humanoid looks clearly inhuman, we can differentiate it from \"real\" humans and thus safely assign it the characteristic of being a \"thing.\" And when it's truly indistinguishable from human, we're also not concerned about it, because we simply read it as human. But entities in the range between these two poles, the not-quite-human, generate unsettling reactions, which is why horror films often feature human-shaped inhumans such as zombies, killer dolls (Chucky and Annabelle) and eerie clowns (\"It\"). All of these are entities that lurk in the uncanny valley, nibbling grotesquely at the edges of our unconscious.Kyoto Animation studio: Destruction is a terrible loss for both humanity and art The uncanny valley is why CGI animation titan Pixar has resisted trying to make movies with photorealistic human characters, choosing instead to lean into more stylized and cartoonish character designs, despite technological advances that make near-perfect realistic human depictions possible. Pixar's sibling companies Marvel and Lucasfilm leveraged this tech to de-age Samuel L. Jackson for the \"Captain Marvel\" movie and to \"resurrect\" Peter Cushing, who died in 1994, to reprise his role as the villainous Grand Moff Tarkin for the 2016 \"Star Wars\" prequel \"Rogue One.\" In \"Cats,\" digitally altered thespians are everywhere, squarely centered in the spotlight, capering and caterwauling, spouting psychedelic dialogue and belting out diva-worthy ballads. From this uncanny valley, there's no escape.It's too soon to say that the film is doomed to failure, however. After all, the original stage musical was an oddity of its own, with an acid-trip fantasy of a storyline about cats gathering to select a candidate to ascend to the afterlife, with characters named Bombalurina, Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer and Bustopher Jones, and nonsensical song lyrics like \"Jellicle Cats meet once a year / At the Jellicle Ball where we all rejoice / And the Jellicle Leader will soon appear / And make what is known as the Jellicle Choice.\"Stay up to date...Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAnd yet the musical managed to run for more than 7,500 performances over almost two decades, making it the longest-running musical on Broadway for its era -- until it was eclipsed by another Webber production, \"Phantom of the Opera.\" As others have pointed out, the movie adaptation might be strange and ridiculous, but so too was its source. It could well be that the movie \"Cats\" will end up being a surprise hit, fueled in part by the lurid fascination that the trailer has incited among viewers who might have otherwise ignored it. And then? Then we might get a movie adaptation of the only Andrew Lloyd Webber musical that exceeds \"Cats\" in freakiness: the humans-on-roller-skates-dressed-as-trains musical \"Starlight Express.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2019", "month": "6", "day": "11"}, "text": {"headline": "opinions", "text": "Ali Stroker made history at Sunday night's Tony awards ceremony as the first person in a wheelchair to win an award.

(CNN)Sunday night's Tony Awards ceremony was a hugely historic one for the disability community as they watched Ali Stroker accept her award for her role in \"Oklahoma!\" Her win for the Best Performance by an Actress in a Featured Role in a Musical made her the first person in a wheelchair to win a Tony. Stroker beamed with pride as the audience gave her a rousing standing ovation, and she dedicated her victory to kids with disabilities.Melissa Blake\"Thank you, thank you so much. This award is for every kid who is watching tonight who has a disability, a limitation, a challenge, who has been waiting to see themselves represented in this arena. You are,\" she said as she triumphantly held up the coveted Tony. As a woman with a disability, I felt such pride as she dedicated her award to young people with disabilities, making them feel seen and heard in an arena like the theater world, which had traditionally excluded them. Indeed, it was a victory for Stroker and for so many others who fight to overcome obstacles. But the next day, I read about another obstacle that Stroker faced during the ceremony. It was a literal obstacle: The stage wasn't accessible. There was no ramp for her to get from her seat in the audience to the stage at New York's famed Radio City Music Hall. So the 31-year-old actress had to wait backstage in case she won instead of sitting in the audience surrounded by her peers.Wheelchair Barbie -- the doll I've been waiting my entire life for\"I would ask theater owners and producers to really look into how they can begin to make the backstage accessible so that performers with disabilities can get around,\" she told reporters after her win. Read MoreMy heart sank because this scene illustrates the everyday ableism people with disabilities face, and it's not an uncommon one. The issue of accessibility is something we're all too familiar with, from theaters without ramps to restaurants with steps to buildings without elevators. The truth is, the world is not made for people with disabilities, and there's no denying the twinge of irony that came with Stroker's win. Here she was, breaking down barriers and shattering disability stereotypes, yet confronted with a barrier to accept the award. In addition, by separating her from her peers and fellow nominees, this lack of a ramp was yet another example of a person with a disability being physically marginalized or separated from a group or community because of being differently abled than everyone else. The rights of disabled Americans are under attackIt's a stark reminder when it comes to disability and accessibility -- namely, that society still needs to do better. For all the talk about inclusion and representation, the disability community continues to remain merely an afterthought, where places are made accessible only after people with disabilities bring it to others' attention that they can't get into a building or onto a stage. It's telling the disability community that they need to conform to the able-bodied world instead of the other way around.I've lived much of my 37 years acutely aware of society's lack of foresight. My elementary school didn't have a ramp until my family and I advocated for one. In high school, just like Stroker, I had to wait backstage to join the rest of my choir because there wasn't a ramp to get directly onto the stage. And there have been countless times in my everyday life where I'm forced to ask a stranger for assistance because something is just out of my reach -- an elevator button, a book on a high shelf or even inserting my debit card while shopping because I can't reach the machine. If you're not disabled, those little things aren't something you'd typically think about, but those are the barriers I've faced every day. Something simple like going to the doctor or meeting friends for lunch can easily turn into an obstacle course of figuring out how I'm going to navigate the world. Getting from point A to point B isn't always a straight shot when you're in a wheelchair, and it can be incredibly frustrating.When it comes to depicting disability, Hollywood keeps 'cripping up'Thankfully, the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) has made the world -- or at least public buildings -- more accessible. The landmark legislation, which became law in 1990, aims to remove barriers and combat discrimination against people with disabilities. According to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, \"The ADA is one of America's most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination and guarantees that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else to participate in the mainstream of American life -- to enjoy employment opportunities, to purchase goods and services, and to participate in State and local government programs and services.\" Yet, also in New York, disability rights groups have filed a major lawsuit against the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the subway, arguing the agency's completion of multiple station renovations without adding accessibility features violates the ADA. So even if Ali Stroker had had a ramp at Radio City, she might still have found herself in a subway station with no elevators or ramps.

(CNN)Once upon a time, millions of people around the world worshipped the television show \"Game of Thrones.\" It seems like another era. But, in fact, only a month back we were all eagerly waiting to see how the eighth season would wrap up the series. Disappointment and fury are now the status quo for longtime fans.USA Today's review of Sunday's penultimate episode was headlined \"The series just burned itself to the ground.\" In the UK, leading TV critic Michael Deacon titled his \"The series has been ruined beyond repair.\" And BuzzFeed is running a slew of articles with headers such as \"The New Snapchat Filter On The 'Game Of Thrones' Cast Will Make You Forget How Terrible Last Night's Episode Was.\"They're not wrong.Kate MaltbyI can't remember the last time I invested as much in a TV show as \"Game of Thrones.\" Over 71 hours watching 72 episodes; extra on behind-the-scenes featurettes; wasted afternoons poring over fan websites like WinterisComing.net and A Wiki of Ice and Fire. (And no, I'm not proud.) Like many of the show's fans, I dreamt up (so I thought) sophisticated ways the show could finish, close-reading the language of prophecies to predict characters' fates. Now it feels like the writers left in custody of my fantasy world have been slipshod in their care. The process is a bit like grief.Read MoreBut aren't we all getting a little bit carried away? It's been reported that super fans have \"google-bombed\" the series' showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, rigging internet search results so that their pictures appear when users search for \"bad writers.\" Which feels, frankly, a bit like bullying. Yes, there's plenty to be angry about. The storylines of women and non-white characters have collapsed into clich\u00e9.Benioff and Weiss seemed to have learned their lesson when the rape of a major character, Sansa Stark, was framed foremost as a traumatic experience for the man forced to watch it. As Vanity Fair's Joanne Robinson put it, \"the last thing we needed was to have a powerful young woman brought low in order for a male character to find redemption.\"  Theon's redemption shows the flaw in 'Game of Thrones'Despite that outcry, in the current season Benioff and Weiss made an almost identical mistake handling the storyline of a woman of color. The final shots of Episode Four closed in on the tortured face of Daenerys Targaryen, a powerful white woman, as she reacted to the execution of her black aide Missandei.Missandei, a former slave, might have had a real story arc of her own, but first she inhabited a classic \"black best friend\" trope and then she became a plot device to spur a white protagonist's revenge. As Sansa to Theon Greyjoy, so Missandei to Daenerys.Daenerys' own arc has been similarly frustrating. In a fantasy culture short of complex heroines, Benioff and Weiss spent seasons building Daenerys into a woman with whom we could identify. Yes, she demanded absolute loyalty. Yes, she was vengeful to those who had wronged her. But she consistently protected the weak. Her first experience of warfare, as a child bride, saw her berate her husband's soldiers for their rape of civilian women.Suddenly, last episode, Daenerys embraced the thrill of genocide, specifically targeting civilians with dragon fire. Personality changes happen in fiction, but not with such lack of subtlety -- not to characters the writers respect and understand.We'd been promised that \"Game of Thrones\" had become a feminist show, but the corruption of Daenerys played into the oldest sexist tropes in the book. The idea of the woman ruler as inconstant goes back to old fears about women's changeable menstrual cycles. Just consider Virgil's \"Aeneid,\" where the unpredictable goddess Juno, bringer of storms, repeatedly contrasts with the rational Jove. Why does 'Game of Thrones' have to make Daenerys Targaryen unlikable?In \"Game of Thrones,\" as Daenerys raged, Juno-like, in the clouds above, it was left to a young man to try to impose some order. In a key moment, we witnessed one of Daenerys' own soldiers attempting the rape of a poor civilian woman. In the first season, Daenerys would have stopped him -- this time, it was Jon Snow who stepped in. In the final iteration of \"Game of Thrones,\" even when there's a rape, it's a woman's fault. Or, in the case of Sansa Stark, as we learned just before Missandei's death, it's a useful character-building device for which the raped woman will one day look back in gratitude. Yep, that really happened in Episode Four. Yet does any of this change the fact that millions of us have loved this show for years? I've written before about hating the last season's treatment of female characters -- it hasn't stopped me waking up early each Monday in the UK to catch the latest installment. If losing a television show we love is like experiencing grief, then let's do what we do to process any other form of grief: focus on remembering the good times. Who will win Game of ThronesThe contemporary web is rich in opportunities for fans to reclaim their fantasy worlds. Within a couple of weeks, I'm sure, fan-fiction websites will be replete with alternative endings -- and why not? I was furious when Jaime Lannister slept with Brienne of Tarth and dumped her, making a fool of her just as the first boys in her youth had notoriously made a fool of her. (Again, Benioff and Weiss love to bring down their strongest women.) So, in my fantasy universe, it simply didn't happen. I might not go as far as writing fan-fiction, but let's be honest -- we all write it in our heads. Fortunately, this rackety final season has left plenty of gaps for the rest of us to flesh out. Once, \"Game of Thrones\" was built on its eye for geographical, political and logistical detail. Now, whole storylines are condensed into a couple of seconds of dialogue. In a recent episode, Daenerys mentioned that a new prince had taken over the region of Dorne and pledged his support. That once would have been three episodes' worth of subplot. It's a mark of the show's decline, but it's good for volumes of alternative fan history. And in my version, Tyrion Lannister will still have a brain.Stay up to date...Sign up for our new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookThe true legacy of \"Game of Thrones\" may be as a cautionary lesson for other producers. Benioff and Weiss built the world's biggest television franchise and screwed it up. But their best ideas may inspire more great shows. It can't be long before another show is brave enough to kill off its lead in a surprise first season. In the meantime, there's nothing as fun as the self-righteousness of telling our friends how it should have ended. Isn't that what the backlash is really all about?

Read MoreFor example: What was largely forgotten during Day's \"America's Virgin\" heyday was that she started out in the late 1930s as a big band singer whose rich tones and sharp diction were inspired by Ella Fitzgerald. Though lacking Fitzgerald's improvisational resources and Frank Sinatra's emotional palette, Day's vocals hold up pretty well today. She achieved widespread popularity with such pop records as \"Sentimental Journey\" (1945), \"Secret Love\" (1953) and, of course, \"Que Sera Sera\" (1956); those last two hits breaking out of the movies that spawned them: \"Calamity Jane\" and \"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\"What's also forgotten is that before the surprise 1959 hit \"Pillow Talk,\" the first in a series of saucy Technicolor farces she did with Rock Hudson, Day showed a sauciness of her own that was decidedly non-virginal. One thinks mostly of \"The Pajama Game\" (1957) in which she appeared with strapping John Raitt wearing the top half of men's pajamas (he's wearing the bottom half).

Stark was everything my friends and I wanted to be: rich (though like some of us, he was helped by a good deal of family money), handsome, sharp-tongued, charming and seductive.

Realizing that the family business has been dealing to both sides and profiting on the bloodshed, Stark's first order of business on coming home is to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons.

But there's more to it than that. Superheroes are our modern mythology, idealizing and modeling the values of the society that creates them. Iron Man accurately reflected the limited horizons of the early 2000s cultural mainstream and was certainly a far better role model for privileged white teens than Christian Bale's Batman, who fulfilled an almost fascist fantasy of working outside the law to clean up the riff raff. Tony Stark at least existed within the society he was saving and showed a genuine (if naive) compassion for the victims of corporate abuse. When, in later Marvel films, world governments seek to regulate superheroes, Tony Stark leads the Avengers faction wishing to comply (of course this regulation turns out to be an evil plot, perhaps also appropriate to outdated values). So, for young men, did Tony Stark once model a good \"ally\" (including all the lack of skin-in-the-game that term represents)? Maybe. Is he the hero we need now? No way. But who is?

And I bet for many fans of Farley, it felt like, in some ways, he never left us.I worked on the production staff at \"SNL\" from 1998 to 2006, and over those years I heard countless stories about Farley from people who worked on the show with him. The one thing the stories all had in common was the sheer amount of joy they would bring to the people recounting Farley's antics. Suddenly, an otherwise low-key person would light up while acting out -- to the best of his or her ability -- what Farley had done in the very place we were standing in the \"SNL\" offices. And of course, laughter would follow as we could all picture Farley in our mind's eye doing exactly what was being described.A 'Saturday Night Live' sketch that Trump should savorSandler's song toasting his late friend on \"SNL\" captured that spirit so well -- with a hint of the bittersweet.Some have pointed out that Sandler had played a version of this song before on his recent Netflix special. But what was so unique and moving about Sandler's rendition on \"SNL\" was that it took place on the very stage that the two close friends shared in the mid-1990s.Given the location, certain lines delivered an added emotional weight, such as when Sandler sang, \"We'd tell him, 'Son, you'll wind up like Belushi and Candy,' he said, 'Those guys are my heroes, that's all fine and dandy.'\" (This was, of course, referring to the late John Belushi and John Candy, both larger than life comedy stars who died way too young.)Read MoreThen there was Sanders' lyric: \"If we make enough noise, maybe he'll hear us,\" pausing as emotion came across his face and the audience cheered.But, clearly, Sandler didn't come to make us cry.

It was a nearly five-minute, much-needed escape from the dysfunction that has consumed America today. Watching the clips of Farley making us laugh from the 1990s as Sandler sang conjured up a simpler time -- one in which the biggest political issues involved Bill Clinton's affair with an intern as opposed to what we are seeing today with President Donald Trump's war on the truth, Russian attacks on our elections and the emboldenment of white supremacists. Although Clinton's affair was indeed a serious matter, it was one that seemed relatively contained, as opposed to the growing issues that threaten lives and the vitality of our democracy today.As the song wound down, Sandler summed up what Farley means to him and to so many others with the line, \"Buddy, life has moved on, but you still bring us so much joy.\" He added, \"Make my kids laugh with YouTube clips or Tommy Boy,\" causing the studio audience to cheer as we saw an image of Farley from the hit 1995 comedy film, \"Tommy Boy.\"Over 20 years after his passing, Farley is still bringing joy to those he touched personally and to those who just enjoyed his comedy.

(CNN)Are women finally cracking the glass ceiling of late-night television? If you ask YouTube phenomenon Lilly Singh, who just became the first woman in decades tapped to host a late-night television show on one of the big four networks, the answer is a resounding yes. This September, Singh's new show -- \"A Little Late with Lilly Singh\" -- will replace Carson Daly's \"Last Call with Carson Daly\" on NBC.  Singh's hiring is not just significant because of her gender. What makes her move especially historic is that she identifies as a bisexual woman of color and has used her popular YouTube channel IISuperwomanII to tackle tough issues, including her mental health struggles and challenges facing the LGBTQ community. Plus, as a millennial, she is uniquely in touch with the pulse of a young and robust generation and can speak directly to the issues facing them -- something we don't have among the current roster of late-night hosts, save for Trevor Noah on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show.\" Melissa BlakeIt's no secret that the world of late night has long been a boys' club, from the heyday of Johnny Carson in the 1970s to David Letterman and Jay Leno in the 1990s. While women such as Samantha Bee have found success on cable networks like TBS, a woman in a prime late-night spot on one of the major networks has largely seemed like an elusive dream -- one within sight, but never quite reachable. (Joan Rivers hosted \"The Late Show\" in 1986, but was ousted only a year later.) With such an absence of women at the forefront of late night, the hot topics covered were and continue to be almost exclusively presented from a male perspective, effectively ignoring the lived reality of half of the American population. And the writer's rooms on these shows only exacerbate the problem. Take, for instance, the makeup of the writing staff on the \"Late Show,\" when Stephen Colbert took over as host in 2015. Just two out of the 19 staffers were women. In his attempts to diversify his writing staff, Colbert told The New York Times: \"We had to take an extraordinary step to get an extraordinary room.\" Now, Colbert says, his room is half white men and \"half either women or writers of color.\" Read MoreThe problem with Stephen ColbertAnd while Colbert's steps at diversification are commendable, considering what some recent news stories have been -- think the #MeToo movement and the backlash against sexual harassment -- it might be helpful to have a woman's perspective presented both on camera and behind the camera. (Of note, Singh will also be an executive producer of the show, which will air at 1:35 a.m. ET, and she'll take a role in shaping content off screen as well.)But even more than simply a boys' club, the landscape of late night has remained a white boys' club -- in much the same way American political leadership has for over 200 years. Yet this model is hardly representative of the United States, which is a melting pot of cultures, ethnicities and voices. And Singh is perhaps the best example of that as a queer woman of color and child of immigrants: Singh's parents are from India, and she was born and raised in Canada.Still, just recently, Leno criticized the current late show climate as being too political. \"You know, everything now is, if people don't like your politics, they -- everyone has to know your politics,\" Leno said on the \"Today\" show.JUST WATCHEDWhy Trump's complaints about late night TV are no jokeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Trump's complaints about late night TV are no joke 04:27It's easy for someone like Leno, an older white male, to say that late-night comics should stay out of politics, but the fact is it's 2019 -- and it would be tone deaf to ignore the political and social challenges facing Americans. In fact, I would argue that it's even more critical that Singh have a show, so she can start national conversations around marginalized communities. Just as she used to call out racism and homophobia on her YouTube channel, Singh can do so on late-night television. And perhaps that kind of candor -- on that kind of scale -- can help bring positive changes to our culture.Late-night television often provides the fodder for the water cooler (or Slack thread) conversations the next morning. So, Singh will soon have a powerful platform to kickstart a conversation on a host of issues, especially as we near the 2020 presidential election.And there is every reason to believe Singh will be a successful host. Her popularity on YouTube has largely been attributed to how down-to-earth and relatable she is. And it's this very relatability -- coupled with her prominence on a powerful internet platform -- that may also help Singh draw in younger viewers, who have not comprised a significant portion of the traditional late-night demographic.

It's hard to think of another celebrity who has come of age under such public scrutiny and has struggled so obviously to reconcile himself with the isolation of fame. Bieber's first hit came when he was just 14 years old, and since then, he's attempted \u2014 in his words, through \"trial and error\" \u2014 to recreate himself, over and over.

I was wearing sunglasses inside.\" But he couldn't even complete his \"Purpose\" tour, because, as he said in his Instagram post, he was \"emotionally unable to give\" what it required. It's impossible to overstate the effects that sensational fame can have on individuals at any age, but it presents very specific dangers to people who encounter fame as young as Bieber did.

She said, \"Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship.\"Holly Thomas This has invited some backlash. Including an important gay romance between the two wizards as an afterthought -- and crucially one expressed in a spin-off film's DVD extras, rather than in the film itself --  feels like a cop-out. How wonderful it would have been for millions of children to have known that Dumbledore was gay from the beginning of the series -- and to have grown up with that knowledge woven into the books. But the evolution of \"Harry Potter\" has now spanned decades, and as such, is complicated by many layers of conflicting context.When Rowling sat down to map out her fantasy universe between 1990 and 1995, she could never have imagined the influence it would have, or the responsibility that would entail. On the face of it, she appeared to do what most authors do, which was illustrate the social issues most personal to her. Rowling was famously broke when she wrote the series, and the theme of class and social segregation on that basis -- muggles vs. pure bloods, abused house elves, etc. -- is prominent throughout the books. Read MoreOf course, as time went on, heterosexual romances were featured in the written series. And the idea that in a school filled with hundreds of teenagers -- let alone the wider world they later explore -- Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger might not meet an openly LGBTQ person at any point is laughable. However, it's easy to forget how much the landscape has changed over the last couple of decades. JUST WATCHEDThe little boy J.K. Rowling can't forgetReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe little boy J.K. Rowling can't forget 01:14\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" was published in 1997, six years before Section 28, a law banning councils and schools in England and Wales from intentionally promoting homosexuality, was repealed in 2003. It would have been very difficult to get an explicit gay romance into a book aimed largely at elementary school-aged children at the time. By the time the later books came out, the massive span of its distribution -- they are sold in 200 countries -- could also have made this tricky.These aren't necessarily good excuses. Philip Pullman introduced a moving relationship between two male angels in \"The Subtle Knife,\" the second of his Dark Materials trilogy, which was also published in the UK in 1997. That book was admittedly aimed at a slightly older age group, but nevertheless, it was managed.For whatever reason, the opportunity to feature more diversity in \"Harry Potter,\" once missed in print, might have been taken on screen. The failure on that score has become less excusable over time, but it is not all J.K. Rowling's fault. Rowling first said publicly that Dumbledore was gay in 2007, during a Q&A with students at Carnegie Hall. She relayed the story of a script reading for the sixth Potter film, during which she had to slip the director a note to explain why a line about the wizard longing after a girl in his youth had to be cut. She explained that Dumbledore falling for Grindelwald added to his horror when the dark wizard turned to evil. JUST WATCHEDRowling reveals secret manuscriptReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRowling reveals secret manuscript 00:51 For Rowling, the significance of this narrative doesn't appear to lie in Dumbledore's sexuality, but in the amplification of a great betrayal. You get the sense that with these explanations, she simply feels she is filling in the blanks.The broader context into which these new remarks have been released hasn't done Rowling any favors. Though her sincerity about her characters is evident, her latest comments on Dumbledore come alongside a distasteful \"trendy\" commodification of LGBTQ culture in recent years. This makes any apparently superficial affiliation look opportunistic -- especially when it is not backed up by any \"visible\" evidence.Rowling also has a track record of making rather tone-deaf proclamations. The reveal that lycanthropy (the power of a human to transform into an animal-like state) was a metaphor for HIV was especially memorable and ill-considered, considering that werewolves could become dangerous and out of control. She also has a tendency to blur the line between fiction and reality -- and use the wizarding world as a tool with which to make sense of the real one. In a 2015 Twitlonger, she explained what Harry's views on Israel might be. As off-key as this comes across in public, this way of thinking is perfectly normal for a fantasy writer. But the sheer scale of Rowling's platform and reach is unprecedented. The highly personal nature of \"Harry Potter\" to so many people places huge pressure on her to maintain an exceptional, universally inspiring standard as a figurehead. She is very visible, very successful and very wealthy. This makes her something of a flashpoint when things go wrong.

The casting of Korean actress Claudia Kim as Nagini, a snake subservient to an evil Nazi-esque villain, and the misattribution of Nagini's name to Indonesian mythology was a major one. It looked especially careless given the criticism the series has historically received for being overtly white.  And Johnny Depp taking on the role of Grindelwald in the wake of huge negative publicity was also controversial. And that doesn't even begin to address the plot and tone of the film, which were generally agreed to be all over the place. It's frustrating that for all the talk off-screen about the significance of Dumbledore's love for another man, that love remains as \"deniable\" on-screen in 2019 as it was when first revealed in 2007.

But there is also a sense of compound pressure on Rowling. \"Harry Potter\" was formative in the childhood of many of today's adults, and continues to engage new readers in a world which is -- at least in part -- vastly more socially aware than it was in 1997. Preserving the past experience of the former while enriching and evolving the Potter universe for the latter was never going to be easy. The books can't be rewritten, but the best hope for the wizarding world might be a vast improvement in the quality of any new movies. A still better one might be for any current or future children's authors to include clear LGBTQ narratives as par for the course, and for those stories to become as beloved, and as influential, as \"Harry Potter.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2015", "month": "3", "day": "2"}, "text": {"headline": "opinion", "text": "It was \"Star Trek's\" exploration of both space and the issues of the day that inspired me to try to apply these moral lessons to students, says Andy Lau.", "full_article_text": "Story highlights\"Star Trek\" actor Leonard Nimoy died Friday at age 83Andy Lau: Nearly every episode had a moral lesson or dilemmaAndy Lau is an associate professor of engineering at Penn State College of Engineering. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)Around 2002, I was browsing in a used book store in Pittsburgh, and there it was: \"The Ethics of Star Trek\" by Judith Barad and Ed Robertson. Coincidentally, I was working at that time on integrating ethics into engineering education at Penn State University. I immediately bought the book, and after reading it through, realized that it could be the basis for an engaging course for our first-year engineering students. I first offered the course, The Ethics of Star Trek, in the fall of 2003 -- and I've been teaching it ever since.My children grew up watching the shows that followed the original series, which continued the tradition established by \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry of tackling current events like war, genocide and pollution. It was good family entertainment that also prompted reflection on issues of the day. And it was this exploration of both space and the issues of the day that inspired me to try to apply these moral lessons to students.First there was the friendship between Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and Dr. McCoy, aka Bones. Plato described the human soul as composed of three aspects: spirit, reason and emotion. Internally, we each strive to balance these three forces. If we manage to do this well, we become a more virtuous person and attain a fourth virtue: justice. By placing Kirk (spirit), Spock (reason) and Bones (emotion) into challenging situations, we get to observe this interplay of these forces, and we get to hear them say what would otherwise be an internal dialogue.Why is Spock so critical here? Because Vulcans worship logic and rationality. Even though he's half human, he suppresses his emotions. It's no surprise that he is the science officer, since science is founded on rationality. Mr. Spock, then, can be trusted to give reasoned scientific analysis in any situation, uninfluenced by emotion or spirit. And since they wouldn't even be in space without science, Spock may be the most important character for the success of the adventure. So, how was all this applied in a classroom? Read MoreThe \"Star Trek class\" is a one-credit seminar for first-year students that meets once a week, one of about 60 different seminars offered by the College of Engineering. Students read relevant chapters in the book, and then every other week we watch a related \"Star Trek\" episode. In the other weeks, we sit in a large circle and have an open and often lively discussion about the ethical ideas and their application to the students' lives. One of the recurring plot elements in \"Star Trek\" is the discovery of new creatures. This often raises the question of the proper relationship and attitude toward these entities. Are they intelligent? Is their intent malicious? In one episode, \"Arena,\" the Enterprise engages in battle with an alien vessel, flown by the Gorn, that has attacked an Earth colony. In the heat of the battle, another unknown species, the Metrons, transports Kirk and the Gorn captain to a barren planet. They are told that because of their violent tendencies, they must battle to the death, with the ship and crew of the loser to be destroyed. As the two captains battle, the Metrons project the scenes onto the Enterprise's main view screen on the bridge. As the crew observes the battle, and thinks more about it, Spock realizes that the Earth colony may have been the invader, and the Gorn vessel may have been justified in its attack on the colony. Kirk also begins to see this as a possibility. When he finally subdues the Gorn captain, Kirk decides to show him mercy and spare his life, even though it may result in the destruction of the Enterprise and her crew. Surprised by this action, the Metrons decide that there may be hope for humans after all, and that we are not primarily savages. This episode has been used in the following week's discussion in various ways, depending on the current events that form the backdrop to the semester. One of my favorite approaches is to have the students consider the ethics of eating meat. I supplement the \"Star Trek\" background with arguments by other philosophers and commentators. It always makes for great discussion because the question hits home, literally, in the gut. At the heart of this question is: What is it about another creature that qualifies it for ethical consideration? Is it rationality? Is it power? Is it utility to humans? Many of the students' arguments are essentially biological -- we are omnivores. They argue further that we are at the top of the food chain and can therefore do whatever we want. For these students, I often start by asking them if they have a pet. If they do, I ask them if I can eat their pet. Or better yet, under what circumstances might it be OK to eat their pet?A key issue that arises from this is that we humans see ourselves as more than just animals; we have reason and a sense of right and wrong, a sense of justice. As the discussion evolves, various indicators of other species' moral standing are investigated, including rationality, ability to experience pain and suffering, utility to humans, and perhaps that these other creatures have intrinsic value regardless of their use to people. Often, students come away with a commitment to reduce animal suffering, and to reduce their consumption of meat overall.My favorite Spock-centered episode is a two-parter, \"The Menagerie,\" which uses scenes from the original pilot, \"The Cage.\" Here we see Spock's human side at its best. Captain Pike, whom Spock used to serve with, has been injured to the point where he can live only as part of a machine, and he can only make a device beep once for yes, and twice for no. (OK, admittedly it's a flaw in the technological imagination.) Spock kidnaps Pike and commandeers the Enterprise, all for as yet unclear reasons. What we find out is that Pike and Spock had visited a planet (in the pilot) where aliens could make you experience any reality they dreamed up for you. They narrowly escaped, and the planet was placed off limits by the Federation. Spock intends to deliver Pike to this planet so that he can live out his life in a reality unconfined by his physical impairment. Along the way, Spock faces a court-martial where a guilty verdict would result in death. Yet his loyalty and love of Pike override his awareness of the irrationality of his actions. (In the end, the court-martial is dropped, and Pike lives long and prospers.)Nearly every episode had a moral lesson or dilemma like this, meaning that not only was \"Star Trek\" great entertainment, but a show that could really make you think. That's why I was saddened to learn of Leonard Nimoy's passing Friday. But it is also something that allows me to take some comfort, because I know that his legacy as Mr. Spock, science officer of the starship Enterprise, will live on.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. (CNN)Everybody on the planet knows that Gene Roddenberry created Mr. Spock, the laconic, imperturbable extra-terrestrial First Officer for the Starship Enterprise. But Mr. Spock doesn't belong to Roddenberry, even though he is the grand exalted progenitor of everything that was, is, and forever will be \"Star Trek.\"Mr. Spock belongs to Leonard Nimoy, who died Friday at age 83. And though he doesn't take Spock with him, he and Spock remain inseparable. Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the re-booted feature film incarnation of \"Trek,\" is excellent in the role. (Nimoy himself said so.) Quinto must know that however much he brings to the role, he will only be its custodian. Spock is Nimoy. Nimoy is Spock. It is, as Spock himself would intone, only logical.Nimoy often insisted otherwise, especially as the show went from canceled outcast to global phenomenon. He even wrote a book with the title, \"I Am Not Spock\" (1977) that was bought by millions of readers who didn't buy the title for a nanosecond. By 1995, he cried \"uncle\" by publishing a followup autobiography, \"I Am Spock.\" In the years before and since, he carried his character's legacy with the grace and class he exhibited in other areas of his life. Read MoreAnd the life of Leonard Nimoy, irrespective of Spock, was a rich and varied feast. Those two \"Spock\" books weren't the only things he'd published. A couple of books of poetry are also credited to him as were a collection of photographs celebrating what he termed \"the feminine aspect of God.\" Which reminds me. Nimoy had a hand, so to speak, in creating one of Spock's most indelible traits: The \"live-long-and-prosper\" split-finger salute that Nimoy had borrowed from an approximation of the Hebrew letter shin, the first letter in the word Shaddai, one of the Hebrew names for God. Roddenberry didn't think of that. Nimoy did. And in doing so made an implausible character as much a part of our waking dreams as members of our own family.He also directed movies, two of which were part of the \"Trek\" franchise: 1984's \"The Search for Spock\" and 1986's \"The Voyage Home.\" I got to meet him when the latter film opened. It was at a press conference that was part of the promotional junket in Los Angeles and Nimoy was very un-Spock-like in his jocular, freewheeling enthusiasm for the movie (which was, in fact, one of the very best, certainly the warmest, of the big-screen \"Trek\" iterations.) He could not stop smiling, not even when one of the reporters asked him about a scene in the film that catches Spock in an impromptu grin. (It vanished once the movie opened in theaters.) He looked like a man who knew he was going to soon have a lot more money than he'd had a week, or a day before -- though anyone with a brain knew he wasn't going to squander any of it on trivial things. He was Nimoy and he was Spock. And they were serious men with serious thoughts.Still, it was always nice to know Nimoy could smile, even if Spock couldn't.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2015", "month": "2", "day": "23"}, "text": {"headline": "opinion", "text": "It was not a night for 'Selma', but its themes of justice, equal rights were all over the Oscar ceremony", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsLZ: Neil Patrick Harris hosting the Oscars was an apt backdrop for theme of fighting inequality that ran through the nightHe says in acceptance speeches actors' advocacy for equality -- for blacks, women, LGBT people -- was timely, movingLZ Granderson is a CNN contributor, a senior writer for ESPN and a lecturer at Northwestern University.

", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsA \"Ghostbusters\" reboot has been announced with all-female leadsBut lack of diversity persists on screen and behind camera in Hollywood, authors sayStacy Smith is the director of the Media, Diversity, and Social Change Initiative at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism at the University of Southern California. Katherine Pieper is a research scientist with the Initiative, which you can follow @MDSCInitiative. The views expressed are their own. (CNN)The Internet was abuzz last week when the cast of the all-female \"Ghostbusters\" reboot was announced. The crop of funny ladies charged with eliminating the undead are some of the top female comedians working today. The chatter and support has a lot to do with the fans these women have garnered. It also comes from groups and individuals -- male and female -- who long to see more women headlining major Hollywood films.So, is \"Ghostbusters\" progress? Yes. Is it a panacea? No. Let's talk about why.Putting women front and center in film is the exception, not the rule. Using \"Ghostbusters\" as an example of how far females have come is like celebrating Kathryn Bigelow's best director Academy Award -- and forgetting that she's the only woman ever to take home that honor. You can applaud Katniss, Elsa, and Anna, too. But, they're following the legions of guys who have protected and ruled the planet, palaces and corporate empires near and far. It's fair and important to celebrate these high-profile moments of progress. Doing so, however, may dismiss the lack of diversity that persists onscreen and behind the camera in Hollywood movies.Our annual statistics on women's participation in the year's 100 top-grossing films reveal stagnation. In 2013, only 29% of 4,506 speaking characters evaluated were female. In another study, we examined popular films from 1990 to 1995. The percentage was 29%. For those of you who think the past was better, other research shows that women clocked in at 25% of characters in a sample of movies from the late 1940s. Interestingly, only 28% of movies in 2013 depicted a female lead or co-lead.Behind the camera it's even worse. Women rarely get to direct large budget features on the scale of \"Ghostbusters\" or \"The Hunger Games.\" Across top-grossing films from 2002 to 2013, only 4.2% of all directors were female. In 2013 and 2014, there were only two female directors each year. Even more dismal figures concern black or African-American female directors. Only three black women were directors across 700 popular movies between 2007 and 2014.Read MoreWhat drives the lack of diversity in films? Our studies with industry leaders (funded by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media and Sundance Institute/Women in Film Los Angeles) reveal that both in front of and behind the camera, perceptions about market forces and money are to blame for the lack of females. Male leads, stories and properties are seen as more profitable, while female stories and casts are seen as a risk. For female directors, the financing structure, subject matter, and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress.Much like pesky poltergeists, these myths about profitability will have to be busted before change can occur. To do so, solutions need to be implemented that overcome implicit biases and circumvent stereotyping.Leveling the playing field when it comes to hiring is one step toward creating a more balanced behind-the-scenes environment. We have previously advocated for a modified version of the NFL's Rooney Rule: a league-wide commitment to interviewing diverse candidates for coaching positions. Applied to Hollywood, the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors.Another solution we're implementing at USC Annenberg is to look holistically at the entertainment industry from decision-making to the content we view. The USC Annenberg Comprehensive Analysis and Report on Diversity will \"grade\" companies based on the diversity within their ranks and the media they create. Media conglomerates can be held accountable for their decisions across film, television and digital productions. While not every story should or can be female-dominated or focus on underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups, examining a slate of content will reveal where and when stories about diverse groups and individuals are valued and told.Right now, lifting the veil on diversity in Hollywood reveals white men standing behind the curtain. In this environment, casting four women to take care of a metropolitan ghost problem does feel rather extraordinary. Sealing up cracks in the development, casting and hiring pipeline for women and underrepresented groups, however, should result in an onscreen reality that is more representative of the world we live in.Then, the only unreal thing about \"Ghostbusters\" will be the ghouls and goblins, not the women busting them.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.  \u200b"}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2015", "month": "1", "day": "27"}, "text": {"headline": "opinion", "text": "Touted by the right as pro-war movie-- and seen as anti-Muslim by bigots--the film is really a study in war's damage.", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsDean Obeidallah: \"American Sniper,\" touted by right as pro-war movie, has inflamed some anti-Muslim rhetoricHe says it's really a powerful anti-war film.

(CNN)I had to see the movie \"American Sniper.\"  Not because of the Oscar buzz but because of the vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Arab comments posted by some on social media after seeing the film.  Dean ObeidallahAs Samer Khalaf, the president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, noted, there have been hundreds of violent messages on Facebook and Twitter directed against Arabs and Muslims made by people who had seen \"American Sniper.\" For example, tweets such as, \"Great f*@##@* movie and now I really want to kill some f*@##@* ragheads,\" \"Nice to see a movie where the Arabs are portrayed for who they really are-vermin scum intent on destroying us\" and  \"American Sniper made me...hate Muslims 1000000X more.\"Being of Arab heritage and Muslim, I had to know: Did the film really portray Arabs and Muslims in way that would naturally draw these types of hateful comments?  Was the film a jingoistic jubilee, like a \"Top Gun\" for a new generation, but where the Muslims/Arabs are now the \"evil empire\" instead of the Soviet Union?  What did I find? The film was not any of those things. \"American Sniper\" is the most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. Read MoreTrue, the film is based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, the decorated Navy Seal sniper who recorded the most \"kills\" in U.S. military history. That fact is likely the reason some on the right have championed the film as a pro-war anthem. But \"American Sniper\" is becoming as misunderstood as Bruce Springsteen's classic song, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" Republicans from Ronald Reagan on have played that song at their campaign events believing it to be a pro-America celebratory anthem. It's anything but that. JUST WATCHEDIraq War vet: 'This film got it right'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIraq War vet: 'This film got it right' 04:29The lyrics of \"Born in the U.S.A\" poignantly criticize the Vietnam War and the way our country treated its veterans after their return to the states. Many didn't listen to the words and so missed Springsteen's point.  It's like this with \"American Sniper.\" The film does more than portray the horrors of war.  That we have seen before. Instead, it focuses on the horrors that come after: the post-war suffering when those who have served come home.Director Clint Eastwood gives us a parade of veterans who have been wounded in some fashion: Lost legs, lost arms, lost hands, lost souls.  Even veterans who appear intact at first glance, turn out to be far from it.  For example, one scene features a veteran in an auto repair garage back in the United States. He recognizes Kyle and after speaking to him for a minute, raises his pant leg to show he is missing a leg. It's not surprising Eastwood would make an anti-war movie. The usually tight-lipped Eastwood recently commented, \"contrary to public opinion, I abhor violence.\" And Eastwood has not only publicly opposed to the Iraq war, he even questioned waging the war in Afghanistan.As to my original reason for seeing the film, to learn whether it incites hatred of Muslims and Arabs? Well, I don't think you are going to like our communities more after seeing the film. But I'm fairly confident that those who made hateful comments about Arabs and Muslim hated us before they stepped into the movie theater. The film just gave them an excuse to voice their bigotry. JUST WATCHEDMaher: 'American Sniper' is 'psychopath patriot'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMaher: 'American Sniper' is 'psychopath patriot' 01:04It's important to note: Kyle was not killed by an Iraqi, but according to police, by a U.S. veteran who allegedly had PTSD. It happened long after he'd returned from the battlefield. He was back home. If people are angry with that or about the fate of the other Americans who suffered in the war, they should focus should not on American Muslims but on those who led our country into a war based on questionable reasons.That doesn't mean I don't wish Eastwood made a more balanced film that would let audiences see the brutality and suffering of both sides in the conflict. There isn't any reference, for example, to the horrors of Abu Ghraib prison where U.S. soldiers infamously tortured Iraqis. Nor was there any reference to the 2006 massacre in Haditha, Iraq, which happened during the period Kyle was in Iraq. That's when U.S. Marines went on a killing spree and slaughtered 24 unarmed Iraqis including women, children and an elderly man in a wheel chair.  And Eastwood's depiction of the Iraqis was almost comically without nuance. Forget character development; the Iraqi version of Kyle, for example -- a sniper known as \"Mustafa\" -- barely registered as one-dimensional. He didn't even speak; he was simply depicted as a silent killing machine. Was Eastwood's use of an almost video game-like violence when it came to killing Iraqis calculated to dehumanize the Iraqi people?  I don't think so.  His focus was not on whom we were fighting, but the unbearably high price Americans pay for waging war regardless of its target. The film is a cautionary tale for Americans about why we must avoid war.  It is not a celebration of waging it. While \"American Sniper\" did garner an Oscar nomination for best picture, Eastwood was not nominated for best director.  But Eastwood deserves a special award -- for making a powerful anti-war film that the right would cheer.Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

(CNN)\"American Sniper\" stormed the box office this past weekend with $105 million in ticket sales. Not since the Rambo movies have so many farmers and ranch hands buddy-upped to the popcorn counter. As much as I adore Bradley Cooper, I won't be seeing the movie. I can't see it.And my reluctance to see it has nothing to do with Michael Moore's flippant assertion that snipers are cowards (although he said he wasn't talking about the movie). I was always taught that cowards are those who refuse to serve their country.Friends who've seen the movie say I'm missing out. They say it is an accurate portrayal of what happens in war.  One friend, who declares herself as a pacifist, urged me to go. \"Far from glorifying war, it made war look brutal, and a means of destroying people for life,\" she said. Karen Spears ZachariasWhat I keep wondering is why all these moviegoers  weren't  lining up to volunteer for war.Before his ironic death, Chris Kyle, on whom the movie is based, denounced Hollywood's version of war. \"Hollywood fantasizes about it and makes it look good.

I have thanked him for that. Still, he regrets that he didn't save him, and I hate that he lives with that.Maybe that's why I can't see the movie. When you have experienced firsthand the multitude of ways war wreaks havoc on families, you have little tolerance for the mythmaking that war always seems to invoke. Not to mention the patriotic, almost nationalistic fervor that accompanies a flag-draped coffin.Related: Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hitWhen my father died there were no crowds gathered at Cowboys Stadium, no JumboTron displaying pictures of the family man my father was, and no front-page stories. There was just a broken family feeling very abandoned by an ungrateful nation.The other reason I can't see the movie is my friend Sgt. Gordon Wofford. Gordon was serving with 9th Infantry Regiment (Manchu), 25th Infantry Division when he was struck by a sniper's bullet on May 28, 1970. The bullet took out his lower jaw and all of his teeth. The company medic, Spec. Ronald Krebsbach, was killed by the next bullet while yanking Gordon to safety. Gordon spent 19 months at Walter Reed relearning skills toddlers know: How to chew. How to talk. How not to slobber all over himself.When I met him in 2005, Gordon was not getting help for his post-traumatic stress disorder. He didn't think he deserved benefits.  Before his death from cancer in 2009, Gordon and I forged a friendship from our experiences in war -- his as a soldier, mine as a Gold Star daughter.Every day as he went through the motions of putting in a set of false teeth, Gordon remembered  the sniper he so longed to forget. Krebsbach, the medic, left behind a young pregnant wife. That always haunted Gordon. He felt bad that he had lived and Krebsbach had died.I serve on a couple of boards of national organizations for veterans. I know by name the men and women who have suffered the aftermath of war. They are not fictional characters to me. Their numbers are in my cell phone. I have wept with them at the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington and at graves at Arlington National Cemetery. I have buried my Gold Star mother beside the only man she ever loved, my father.Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hitHollywood has a way of fictionalizing war, of making it all about \"us\" and \"them.\" \"Ragheads\" was one of the names Kyle gave to the Iraqi people. He said he didn't give a \"flying f**k about the Iraqis.\" Kyle dehumanized them. He had to. That's how the military trains snipers like him. \"Every person I killed I strongly believe that they were bad,\" Kyle told the BBC.I have traveled to my father's battlefield in Vietnam and I have befriended Vietnamese who lost even more than I did during the war.  I have learned there is no \"us\" and \"them.\" There is only \"us.\"Humanity.

(The other was for best song: \"Glory,\" the Golden Globe-winning anthem co-written by Common and John Legend, which one can safely label the prohibitive early favorite its category.)Much of the anger was tilted, especially, toward the omission of the film's director, Ava DuVernay, whose nomination would have broken fresh ground as the first African American woman to compete for the best director Oscar.David Oyelowo's performance as King was likewise snubbed for a best actor slot while neither Paul Webb's original screenplay nor Bradford Young's cinematography, both deemed worthy competitors by movie critics, received the Academy's acknowledgment in both their respective categories.

It's much harder to think of a Hollywood movie in which African Americans are depicted as the active agents of their own salvation. \"Selma\" is one of those movies. And its relative dearth of worthy nominations is viewed, fairly or not, as a collective snub of not just a movie, but of African Americans' vision of their own empowerment. It may have been bad timing, as the movie's nationwide release only took place last weekend. And many blamed Joseph A. Califano Jr.'s opinion piece in The Washington Post, which excoriated \"Selma's\" depiction of his former boss, Lyndon B. Johnson, as an impediment in King's campaign. That some journalists brought up Califano's grievances in other articles about the film may have contributed to some restraint, at least, in the campaign for greater Oscar support by Paramount, Selma's distributor. But one wonders about this: We are in a time when the voting rights legislation passed 50 years ago with the active support of both King and LBJ is under siege both in the courts and in some states. Why are people less focused on this clear and present danger and more caught up in questions of historical veracity of a Hollywood movie? Well ... we're still weeks away from the final vote. And however the chatter has leaned on \"Selma,\" those who support the movie should be grateful that there is chatter at all carrying the movie to the finish line. With Hollywood, one never knows.

Martin Luther King Jr.'s 86th birthday, the Academy Awards decided to snub a beautiful film made about a seminal moment in his life. \"Selma\" did pick up two nominations, including one for best picture. But when the Hollywood gods consider a film to be truly great, its actors and/or actresses, screenplay and particularly its director are also recognized. \"Selma\" is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters. Those voters are 93% white, 76% male and the average age is 63, according to a 2012 analysis by the Los Angeles Times. But did those demographics play a role in how \"Selma\" was received? True, the historical drama has been besieged by criticism over accuracy, particularly its portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson. In the film, King and Johnson are depicted as a lot more adversarial than the actual tapes of their conversation suggests.  But it's hard to see that being the reason for its snub: \"Gravity\" was nominated for 10 Oscars, won seven, and yet you won't find an astronaut who would describe the film as accurate. And \"Dallas Buyer's Club\" was also a 2014 Oscar darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story. Race could be invoked as a factor when you remember the email exchange between two top-level Sony executives that became public courtesy of  \"The Interview\" hack. In it they joked about the kind of movie President Obama prefers and then began listing only those starring black people. But the two were also unkind to Jeffrey Katzenberg in that same exchange.

Some, sure. But all? Remember, these people live in a land of make believe, where it's normal for the inhabitants to be injected with silicone. Oscar snubbings could come from a thousand superficial reasons, like someone sleeping with or not sleeping with the right person at the right time. In a town full of gay men, the heart wrenching \"Brokeback Mountain\" somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre \"Crash.\" Leonardo DiCaprio's trophy case continues to sit empty. And I will never understand how \"Shakespeare in Love\" beat \"Saving Private Ryan\" for best picture. Truth be told. my favorite film of 2014 was \"The Drop\" and I don't think that was nominated for anything by anyone.  It would have been wonderful to see \"Selma\" director Ava DuVernay become the first black female director nominated for an Oscar. She is incredibly talented and it is always nice to be recognized by peers.

To paraphrase the acceptance speech Common gave at the Golden Globes on Sunday, \"Selma\" the movie and Selma the historic marches are about the awakening of our humanity. The old guard at the Oscars has the power to snub \"Selma\" for whatever reason it sees fit.

(CNN)In 2014, beheading a westerner proved to be a chillingly effective strategy for Islamic militants. The killings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning and Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig were both barbaric and uniquely modern. The murderers acted with a key demographic in mind, knowing that millions of people would tune in to watch. So the camera has created a new kind of crowd in the course of our long history of public beheadings. Its entrance on the scene, in France, on 17 June 1939, had a similarly immediate and unequivocal effect. Frances LarsonThat morning, the public guillotining of German serial killer Eugen Weidmann, outside the Saint-Pierre prison in Versailles, was filmed by a spectator -- unbeknownst to the authorities. You can see the footage online today. Photographers also recorded the action, and their pictures filled newspapers and magazines in the days after Weidmann's death. As if the rowdy crowds on the day were not bad enough, now the action could be viewed again and again by untold thousands of voyeurs.

JUST WATCHEDWhy no masks in ISIS beheading video?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy no masks in ISIS beheading video? 02:33For centuries, public executions had been intended to terrify by example, when for many they were little more than light entertainment. The advent of film proved this beyond doubt.If the history of beheadings tells us anything, it is that there will always be people who want to see. Today the Internet offers us front-row seats, on the understanding that no one need know we have taken our places to watch. Murders can be \"nothing to do with us\" even as we click on the screen to play the film.In the 21st century, spectators experience a sense of detachment from the event -- which has already happened at some point in the past and in \"another world\" supposedly far removed from our own -- alongside an unprecedented sense of intimacy. Now we can watch close-up, but in private, in our own time and space. The recent ISIS beheadings were experienced by many viewers like a gruesome serial drama, and the murderers know we will tune in for the next episode. Even those who do not watch the ISIS \"show\" can hardly avoid the media analysis that accompanies each instalment.  Producing these films requires relatively little organization, money or complicated technology. Compared to other terrorist offenses, it is low-tech and high-impact. The action can be carefully choreographed while retaining its ruthless authenticity, and the results are sensational. If the history of beheadings tells us anything, it is that there will always be people who want to seeFrances LarsonThe camera has become a new stage for public beheadings, a new spike for displaying a trophy head. When pathological criminals behead innocent civilians, the murderers address their audience and present their spoils, drawing those who watch into their narrative. The entire spectacle denotes the powerlessness of the victim, and, by extension, the powerlessness of their countrymen to intervene.Spectators who watch beheadings online impotently fulfil the perpetrators' desire to be seen. The ISIS murderers have relied on sophisticated manipulation of social media sites to ensure that their footage appears on our screens before we even know what we are watching. At the same time, a person's reaction can reverberate through the cyber-crowd instantaneously, creating the kind of group mentality that mirrors the dynamics of a real crowd. When the footage of James Foley's murder circulated via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook in August 2014, a Syrian activist named Hend Amry asked people not to share it and initiated the hashtag #ISISmediablackout. \"Pour water on their flame,\" she tweeted. The movement to boycott the film gathered momentum in the hours that followed, and Twitter responded by removing tweets that embedded the video or screenshots of it. For the first time since the death of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2004, the silent majority found a voice, and more and more members of the crowd refused to watch.A group of militants had tried to make an impact, in an appalling way, and their efforts were beginning, just beginning, to fail.When the victim of a beheading is bound and defenceless, he or she becomes a pawn in somebody else's production. The power no longer derives from the act of decapitation itself, which may require a pathological perpetrator, but it does not require the luck and skill to win a fight. Instead, the power emerges from the reception the slayer receives as he plays his part on the stage. There is no triumph in the killer's actions until we watch. Modern technology may offer a hiding place to voyeurs, but it can also give a voice to human decency. No good can ever come from murder, but if public opinion is able to neutralize the killers' triumph by refusing to broadcast the graphic imagery they want us to see, then this is a step forward.Read: More barbaric ISIS video expected, analyst says"}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "5", "day": "22"}, "text": {"headline": "sport", "text": "Jumping between high-rise buildings, launching themselves off cliffs and gliding across rooftops are commonplace for parkour group Storror.

There are also lies, deceit, false imprisonment and a faked death; and that's just episode one.Mosquera's character becomes entangled in a web of deceit.Mosquera is affable and light-hearted and on the surface comes across nothing like his brooding alter ego Beltran -- who often portrays a bad boy image, but is ultimately misunderstood -- though the actor says the two share some similarities.\"There are small nuances that I maybe have in my personality,\" he says. \"For him, his family is his group of friends and I also have a relationship with my friends as if they were my family. \"I am a very stubborn and very persistent person, like Hugo is, and I think apart from the things he's forced to do to find the truth, he actually has a big heart, which is something I try to have and to be a good person.\"Mosquera believes his background in football helped smooth his transition into the acting world.Perseverance, teamwork -- he says sometimes filming can take place with more than 100 colleagues -- as well as staying in shape and following a regimented diet were all disciplines that he'd know as a footballer.As a central defender in his playing days, the 27-year-old says his main inspiration was Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos but, as a football fan, nothing beats watching Lionel Messi.\"For me, he's the greatest player in history,\" says the actor.As for acting role models, Mosquera looks up to Hollywood superstar and fellow Malague\u00f1o Antonio Banderas, somebody he has admired since he was a child.Jesus Mosquera with 'Toy Boy' co-stars Carlos Scholz, Raul Martiato, Maria Pedraza, Jose de la Torre and Carlo Constanza.Mosquera appears to have taken his meteoric rise to stardom in his stride.Murder mystery series 'Toy Boy' initially debuted on Antena 3, one of Spain's biggest TV channels, before moving over to Netflix. On top of the hours of classes and rehearsals, Mosquera was also trained to deal with this new-found fame.\"One minute you're someone anonymous and then suddenly you're on the tele,\" he says. \"For me, it's what I like least about my work. Honestly, fame is not what attracts me. But it is a part of my job and I am also aware that if you have that success, it's because of the public. \"So when they stop me in the street, ask to speak to me and take photos and I see their excitement of meeting someone who has influenced them or helped them, it makes me really happy to be able to share that with them.\"Life in lockdownLike the rest of us, Mosquera has been impacted by the quarantine regulations that have been put in place across most of Europe, with Spain particularly badly hit by the coronavirus.He hasn't been able to see his grandparents since the lockdown began for fear of infecting them and his new career has temporarily been put on hold.However, Mosquera is sanguine about the current situation and isn't taking his health and that of his friends and family for granted.He has also been dedicating the additional spare time to hone his still very new acting skills by taking online classes, reading more and watching inspiring documentaries -- he particularly recommends 'The Ronda Rousey Story.'Mosquera is still optimistic series two of 'Toy Boy' will be filmed once the world returns to normal, which means there can be no slacking on his diet or training.Mosquera's fledgling acting career has been put on hold due to the pandemic.\"I usually do enough exercise to make me sweat because if not, imagine eating all day ... we'll all end up like this,\" he laughs, gesturing a round belly.\"I always try to exercise in the morning because it helps me to clear my mind but I also think there's no need to go crazy working out, it's just to help a little psychologically.\"We're all currently in a very delicate situation and I'm just trying to be positive and approach it in the best way possible.\"The extra downtime has also given Mosquera plenty of opportunity to reflect on the way his life has somersaulted during the last 18 months.Even now, almost a year ago to the day that the team wrapped up filming for the first series, Mosquera can sometimes still scarcely believe the new life he is living.\"The opportunity to take part in the casting for the series crossed my path,\" he says. \"And it was something that changed my life.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "8", "day": "16"}, "text": {"headline": "africa", "text": "It is one of the most anticipated Nollywood films of all time and the trailer for King Of Boys: The Return Of The King\u00a0was released Monday amid frenzy from fans of the crime and political thriller, who call themselves the KOB Army.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)It is one of the most anticipated Nollywood films of all time and the trailer for King Of Boys: The Return Of The King\u00a0was released Monday amid frenzy from fans of the crime and political thriller, who call themselves the KOB Army.The seven-part project is Netflix's first Original Series from Nigeria and a sequel to the highly acclaimed 2018 King of Boys movie directed by leading director Kemi Adetiba.

It was the sophomore film by Adetiba, whose directorial debut, The Wedding Party, was the unopposed Nollywood movie of the year 2016, being the highest-grossing film until January 2021 and spotlighting Adetiba, who already made her mark in the music and television industry, as a filmmaker of note. Nollywood hearthrob, Richard Mofe-Damijo plays the role of Reverend Ifeanyi in King Of Boys: The Return Of The King.The new installment will see old characters from the original, including actor Toni Tones, who reprises her role as a young Eniola Salami and musician Reminisce as Makanaki. It also introduces new characters who have a bone to pick with Salami. Among them are seasoned actors Nse Ikpe-Etim and Nollywood heartthrob Richard Mofe Damijo. King of Boys is a departure from the cheery, bright romcom of The Wedding Party into the dark crime-filled world of Eniola Salami, whose quest for power leaves a trail of dead bodies in her wake.It was a wager which paid off in an industry known of late for primarily producing comedies to meet the audience's demand. Of the top 10 highest-grossing Nollywood movies, King of Boys is the sole thriller on the list. Trusting the audienceAdetiba says the successful outing taught her not to cage her audience. \"I remember once in film school, an instructor said, 'If you treat your audience as if they were intelligent, they'll love you for it,'\" she says. \"Yes, I was told that the audience wasn't ready for a film like KOB.\" Still, Adetiba and her brother, Remi Adetiba, who co-produces the franchise, persisted in bringing the project to light. \"Running on blind faith, we were all, \"Go Big Or Go Home.\" It was our very own 'Do It Afraid' moment, but we jumped in the deep end, and our amazing audience, aka KOB ARMY, thanked us with their massive support. Just as my instructor said.\"Kenyan Netflix exec on producing during a pandemic and amplifying Africa's creative potentialNot only was the genre a deviation from the norm in modern Nollywood, but her lead figure was complex in a way that is rarely done in the industry, where characters are usually portrayed as either good or evil. Adetiba says it was vital for her to highlight this complexity because it mirrors real life.\"I love my characters to be relatable...There are many facets to you and I. Understanding this then creating a character that is one-dimensional is an injustice.\"\"So when I'm creating a character like Eniola Salami ... I'm interested in who s(he) is to all those different people. In Eniola's\u00a0life, we have her family, those she encounters in\u00a0everyday life, her legit business customers, then her interactions... in the 'underworld.'\" Adetiba says the production has been a real labor of love and promises a great time. \"We threw everything into this production... including the kitchen sink. We gave everything we had, so it's a product of REAL\u00a0love, blood, sweat and tears.

But the American film industry is clearly grappling with societal fault lines that the ex-President widened during his time in power.

He is an executive producer of \"The Story of Late Night,\" a new CNN Original Series on the history of the iconic genre. Watch on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT starting May 2, and listen to Carter's companion podcast \"Behind the Desk: The Story of Late Night\" here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, the pandemic has disrupted the business of late-night television (and every other kind of business and form of entertainment) in ways the industry had never experienced in its more-than 60-year history. In the deepest moments of the crisis last spring, all the shows found themselves shut down, with no immediate prospect of when, how or if they could continue in production. But as they played around with what the latest technology made possible, the shows discovered that at least some of the essence of late night as we know it could go on \u2014 albeit in a limited, hangout, seat-of-the-pants basis. So Jimmy Fallon wound up in his country house with his adorable daughters romping around, Seth Meyers looked like he moved into his attic, and James Corden decamped for his garage, where he said he had previously never done a lick of work before. Nobody got haircuts or had their funny comments punctuated with rimshots. And everybody told jokes with no audience laughter to supply affirmation \u2014 a remarkable thing for experienced TV hosts and comics to take on. (What comic doesn't get the shakes if even two straight jokes don't get laughs?) Now, with the gradual lifting of the restrictions the pandemic imposed, a different question looms: Will the shows go on the same way they used to? It's unlikely. After all, genies don't crawl back into bottles. And cost considerations were already looming like a menacing storm over the future of late night. So it's likely some, or many, of the changes we have seen in late night over the past year will solidify into new conventions.Read MoreLate-night hosting is a dream job for some, but it's a lot harder than it looksThat almost surely will be the case with guest interviews. If a guest really isn't coming to New York for a reason other than promoting his/her movie with Fallon, why pay the five-star hotel and the personal hair and makeup artists? Especially if it's not an A-lister we're talking about. A conversation on Zoom still has hazards \u2014 video or sound interruptions, chiefly. But mostly they work fine, and audiences have seen the rough edges to these exchanges and mostly rolled with them.It's true that guest interactions with hosts are much better when they are more than a forced chat. Fallon likes to get them into games with him, for example. And the \"repartee\" that has generated some of late night's greatest moments is much harder to reproduce remotely.I also suspect that just seeing many of the most glamorous stars, not only from the neck up but in their full glory, will still have a strong appeal. It has been the habit in late night for some time that female stars, in particular, come to the shows dressed spectacularly, as though for a movie opening.Another question is what to do about the bands. They are a regular, substantial item in the budget, and they've been hugely important in livening up audiences and sending the signal that what you're watching is a big-time entertainment show. Some shows may find the economics compel some tinkering with the size of bands; some may drastically reduce the number of players; and some may decide that a band is ultimately an expensive luxury for a scaled-down show. The big network shows have also had costume and prop departments. Maybe those get farmed out on an \"as-needed\" basis.The constant, though, will be the live audience. I have talked with many of the current hosts, and getting back to hearing spontaneous laughter generated by their work is like breathing on their own after being in a diving bell. The experience is exhilarating. So even if the studios of the future are far smaller than Jimmy Kimmel's big theater on Hollywood Boulevard, or the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway for Stephen Colbert, there are still going to be fans lining up to find a seat where they can be entertained.The pandemic won't be the end of movie theaters, but it will forever change themMy guess is also that we'll see some contraction in the number of shows that fit the description of a late-night show \u2014 a talented host, topical jokes, some conversation and sometimes some music \u2014 because even as their economic base has eroded, they have proliferated like sneaker styles.Some of these shows may fade away; but not too many. I would predict that if the genre got down to just a few regular shows \u2014 maybe six or seven \u2014 some of them would start doing better, and then networks, streaming services or websites would be right back to saying: Hey, we should try one of these.To say late-night shows had never expected to face anything remotely close to a situation like the pandemic would be akin to saying dinosaurs never expected to find themselves challenged to deal with the sudden arrival of an asteroid.Maybe if they had had Zoom they could have managed.The truth is, pre-Zoom, late night probably could not have managed either. But with small computer-linked cameras, and especially with the ubiquity of Zoom making remote conversations with guests not only acceptable but life-saving, the shows didn't have to abandon the old \"must-go-on\" mantra. They could, and they did."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "3", "day": "26"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "The one where Courteney Cox forgets she was even on \"Friends.\" The actress appeared via video on Jimmy Kimmel, where she revealed she really doesn't remember much about playing the tightly wound chef Monica Geller.

", "full_article_text": " (CNN)Earnest to a fault, \"Respect\" spells out a handsome tribute to Aretha Franklin, with Jennifer Hudson and her peerless singing pipes as its formidable anchor. Yet this biography never fully sparks to life, as the Queen of Soul fights in episodic fashion to establish and later protect her musical legacy from the domineering men in her life.Although Franklin's family spoke out against \"Genius: Aretha,\" a National Geographic miniseries that garnered a well-deserved Emmy nomination for star Cynthia Erivo, the two projects actually complement each other. \"Genius'\" main advantage comes from the latitude to flesh out Franklin's painful youth, from being sexually victimized to losing her mother, while \"Respect\" -- even at nearly 2 \u00bd hours -- races through those moments, which still loom large in the story.Cynthia Erivo in 'Genius: Aretha' (National Geographic/Richard DuCree)The movie begins with the 10-year-old Aretha being pulled out of bed by her father, pastor C.L. Franklin (Forest Whitaker), to entertain at a party, singling her out as a prodigy. Yet that gift parallels with a life filled with hardship, which doesn't get any easier when the 20-ish Aretha lands a record contract, with her dad describing her as \"a Black Judy Garland.\"Crooning ballads, however, didn't capitalize on her talents, and before long dad's counsel was shunted aside by Aretha's relationship and marriage to Ted White (Marlon Wayans, effective in a dramatic turn), a slick hustler whose temper and jealousy go hand in hand with his conviction that he knows what's best for his wife's career.Jennifer Hudson thinks she knows why Aretha Franklin chose her for 'Respect'It's around then that \"Respect\" earns its biggest dollops of it, presenting the recording sessions that birthed some of Franklin's signature hits. Not only do those sequences give Hudson an opportunity to shine, but they conjure an appreciation for Aretha's artistry as seen through the eyes of the musicians accompanying her, always a challenge with this sort of biographical tale.Read MoreStill, the movie's structure -- directed by Liesl Tommy from Tracey Scott Wilson's screenplay -- feels as if it somewhat arbitrarily bounces from one moment to the next over what amounts to this pivotal 20-year span.That stretch includes Franklin's involvement in the civil-rights movement and friendship with Martin Luther King Jr. (Gilbert Glenn Brown), but it also leaves lots of material on the cutting-room floor, as evidenced by a closing clip and lengthy crawl that details what a force the Queen remained late into her life.To its credit \"Respect\" depicts Franklin's bouts with alcohol and snappishness toward those close to her, including her sisters, creating a flawed, three-dimensional character. The supporting cast also includes Marc Maron as producer Jerry Wexler, who respected his star enough to accede to her creative demands, though seldom without a good deal of exasperation and complaining.The daunting task of translating the lives of musical icons to film has a compensatory track record of being rewarded with Oscar nominations, with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Judy\" among recent examples.Having been anointed by Franklin herself to portray her, Hudson earns her place in that company. Yet in terms of a movie that completely does right by its star and regal subject, that little prayer hasn't been answered.\"Respect\" premieres Aug. 13 in US theaters.

Follow him on Twitter @GeneSeymour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)Being the first successful Black male lead in mid-20th-century American movies wasn't necessarily Sidney Poitier's greatest achievement. It was the example he set on and off screen to help ensure he wasn't the only one. Or the last.  Gene Seymour Poitier, whose death at 94 was announced Friday, lived long enough not only to reap full and proper acclaim for his groundbreaking body of work as a film actor, but to also witness wave after wave of Black actors, actresses, writers, directors and craftspeople following the path he helped clear for them to win their own Hollywood niches -- and their own Oscars to go along with the one he historically won for lead actor for 1963's \"Lilies of the Field.\" As far as other Black male film stars are concerned, let's put it as simply, and starkly, as possible: Without Sir Sidney Poitier, there is no Billy Dee Williams, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Forest Whitaker, Michael B. Jordan or, for that matter, that other Michael Jordan, whose ability to parlay his fearsome basketball skills into a cross-cultural, multi-media hyphenate was at least partly enabled by Poitier, who made it safe for Black culture heroes in all kinds of endeavors to connect with Whites as well as other Blacks. Read MoreSidney Poiter in the movie \"A Raisin in the Sun\" in 1961.  Indeed, when you consider Black male presence in cinema before Poitier's movie debut in 1950's \"No Way Out\" up to a present day -- with Black actors as diverse as Washington, Whitaker, Jordan, Delroy Lindo, Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, LaKeith Stanfield, Leslie Odom Jr, Brian Tyree Henry, Anthony Mackie, Daniel Kaluuya and Aldis Hodge appearing in comparably diverse screen roles -- the full measure of what Poitier managed to achieve, practically by himself, is, saying the least, awe-inspiring. In a postwar America moving steadily, if warily, away from racial segregation, Poitier fulfilled Black movie audiences' desire for an articulate, youthful and physically magnetic embodiment of their aspirations. He did so while appealing to White audiences for those same qualities -- along with a disarming reserve, replete with wry mischief and just enough mystery to keep them guessing what lay beneath his cool, dry exterior.  His stardom emerged from Eisenhower-era \"social problem pictures\" like \"Blackboard Jungle\" (1955), \"Edge of the City\" (1957) and \"The Defiant Ones\" (1958), where his role as a chain-gang escapee handcuffed to Tony Curtis's bigoted White convict garnered his first Oscar nomination. With the 1961 adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry's play \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" where he reprised the role of put-upon family man Walter Younger that he created in the stage version, Poitier established himself as the most identifiable African-American leading actor in movies.  As he was testing the breadth of his mass appeal and, as film historian Donald Bogle writes, giving \"Black Americans a significant reason for going to the movies,\" Poitier was aware that he was also testing the levels of racial tolerance. Most of his roles from the 1950s through the 1960s, befitting an era shaped by Brown v. Board of Education and the civil rights movement, were linked by varying tensions between his Black characters and Whites' reactions to them.

In 1965's \"A Patch of Blue,\" he was Gordon, a warm-hearted Black man who shows kindness to a poor and blind White girl (Elizabeth Hartman), whose growing love for him is shortchanged, at the end, by him.   This came three years after the role that won Poitier the Oscar for Best Actor (many, including Bogle, believe he should have won for \"Raisin\") for \"Lilies of the Field,\" in which he played a jovial, if world-weary, ex-soldier who runs into a group of refugee German nuns in the Arizona desert in need of their own chapel. Considered light and fluffy even when it premiered in 1963, the movie nonetheless charmed viewers, and Poitier's charisma and skills were as dominating as ever. Yet almost as many contemporary audiences wince at what they now see as a paradigmatic, anachronistic exemplar of what is now referred to as the \"magical negro\" movie, in which Black characters' only real purpose is to carry out near-miraculous salvation for White characters. Poitier was aware of the tightrope history had asked him to walk: having to widen the possibilities for both his career and his fellow Black performers and maintain his dignity and artistry without alienating Whites in the perilous years of the civil rights era. He was intent on finding roles where race, as such, didn't matter to the plot, like 1965's \"The Bedford Incident,\" or expanded the masses' expectations for Black actors, as in 1966's \"Duel at Diablo.\"  His greatest year, in terms of visibility, was 1967, which yielded the trifecta box-office triumphs of \"To Sir, With Love,\" \"In the Heat of the Night\" and \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner,\" a romantic comedy about an impending interracial marriage where, in the role of a too-good-to-be-true doctor in the running for a Nobel Prize, he achieved apotheosis as a paragon of virtue who Americans at large would have to be insane to lock out of their living rooms. Yet once again, Poitier's command of the screen and his delicate radar for nuance kept the saccharine from overpowering the enterprise. Sidney Poitier  and Rod Steiger on the set of \"In the Heat of the Night\" in 1967. Ironically, as Poitier reached this career peak, his image was under siege by increasing militancy among African American audiences and critics who believed the movement toward racial integration had been overpowered by imperatives for Black nationalism. The late Clifford Mason, a Black cultural critic, wrote a scathing piece for the New York Times that year, \"Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?\" which, while acknowledging Poitier's heroic efforts to break down Hollywood's once-impregnable race barriers and giving him props for being allowed to slap back at a White southern aristocrat in \"In the Heat of the Night,\" insisted that Poitier has over 20 years, \"play[ed] essentially the same role, the antiseptic, one-dimensional hero.\"  More than 50 years have passed and, saying the least, you don't hear such things being said about Poitier or his oeuvre. That's partly because Poitier, instead of retreating from or reacting badly to such criticism, continued to broaden both his movie image and his professional palate, giving Black audiences a romantic comedy of their own with 1968's \"For Love of Ivy,\" playing a militant revolutionary in 1969's \"The Lost Man,\" and directing his own movies, notably with a tandem of comedies written by award-winning playwright Richard Wesley, 1974's \"Uptown Saturday Night\" and 1975's \"Let's Do It Again,\" which became \"crossover\" hits in their amiable depictions of working class Black life.

He was 94.Clint Watson, press secretary for the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, confirmed to CNN that Poitier died Thursday evening.Poitier overcame an impoverished background in the Bahamas and softened his thick island accent to rise to the top of his profession at a time when prominent roles for Black actors were rare. He won the Oscar for 1963's \"Lilies of the Field,\" in which he played an itinerant laborer who helps a group of White nuns build a chapel. Many of his best-known films explored racial tensions as Americans were grappling with social changes wrought by the civil rights movement. In 1967 alone, he appeared as a Philadelphia detective fighting bigotry in small-town Mississippi in \"In the Heat of the Night\" and a doctor who wins over his White fianc\u00e9e's skeptical parents in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\" Poitier's movies struggled for distribution in the South, and his choice of roles was limited to what White-run studios would produce. Racial taboos, for example, precluded him from most romantic parts. But his dignified roles helped audiences of the 1950s and 1960s envision Black people not just as servants but as doctors, teachers and detectives. Sidney Poitier Fast FactsRead MoreAt the same time, as the lone Black leading man in 1960s Hollywood, he came under tremendous scrutiny. He was too often hailed as a noble symbol of his race and endured criticism from some Black people who said he had betrayed them by taking sanitized roles and pandering to Whites. \"It's been an enormous responsibility,\" Poitier told Oprah Winfrey in 2000. \"And I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.\" As a young actor he overcame enormous challenges The youngest of seven children, Sidney Poitier was born several months premature in Miami on February 20, 1927, so tiny he could fit in his father's hand. His parents were tomato farmers who often traveled to and from Florida and the Bahamas. He was not expected to live. His mother consulted a palm reader, who assuaged her fears. \"The lady took her hand and started speaking to my mother: 'Don't worry about your son. He will survive,' \" Poitier told CBS News in 2013. \"And these were her words; she said, 'He will walk with kings.' \" Sidney Poitier as a teacher who must win over his students in a still from the 1967 film \"To Sir, with Love.\" When he was 15, Poitier's parents sent him from the Bahamas to live with an older brother in Miami, where they figured he would have better opportunities. His father took him to the dock and put $3 in his hand. \"He said, 'take care of yourself, son.' And he turned me around to face the boat,\" Poitier told NPR in 2009. Poitier didn't like Miami and soon headed north to New York, where he tried his hand at acting. It did not go well at first. With limited schooling, he had trouble reading a script. But he got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, where a fortuitous encounter changed his life. An elderly waiter took an interest in the teen and spent nights after work reading the newspaper with him to improve his comprehension, grammar and punctuation. \"That man, every night, the place is closed, everyone's gone, and he sat there with me week after week after week,\" Poitier told CBS News. \"And he told me about punctuations. He told me where dots were and what the dots mean here between these two words, all of that stuff.\" Soon after, Poitier landed work with the American Negro Theatre, where he took acting lessons, softened his Bahamian accent and landed a stage role as an understudy to Harry Belafonte. This led to roles on Broadway and eventually caught the attention of Hollywood. Actor Sidney Poitier, left, with actor Tony Franciosa, talk show host David Susskind, singer Harry Belafonte and actress Shelley Winters on the talk show \"Open End\" in 1960 in New York City.He refused to take roles he felt were demeaning Poitier's first movie was 1950's \"No Way Out,\" a noir film in which he played a young doctor who must treat a racist patient. That led to increasingly prominent roles as a reverend in the apartheid drama \"Cry, the Beloved Country,\" a troubled student in \"Blackboard Jungle\" and an escaped prisoner in \"The Defiant Ones,\" in which he and Tony Curtis were shackled together and forced to get along to survive. With that 1958 film, Poitier became the first Black man to be nominated for an Oscar. But for a dark-skinned actor in the 1950s, finding complex roles was difficult. \"(Blacks) were so new in Hollywood. There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,\" Poitier told Winfrey. \"I had in mind what was expected of me -- not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself.\" Sidney Poitier with Lilia Skala in 1963's \"Lilies of the Field.\" The role earned him an Oscar.Early on, Poitier made a conscious decision to reject roles that weren't consistent with his values or that reflected badly upon his race. He told Winfrey that as a struggling young actor, he turned down a role that paid $750 a week because he didn't like the character, a janitor who didn't respond after thugs killed his daughter and threw her body on his lawn. \"I could not imagine playing that part. So I said to myself, 'That's not the kind of work I want.' And I told my agent that I couldn't play the role,\" Poitier said. \"He said, 'Why can't you play it? There's nothing derogatory about it in racial terms,' and I said, 'I can't do it.' He never understood.\" Still, by the late 1950s, Poitier was landing regular acting work. He appeared in the first Broadway production of \"A Raisin in the Sun\" in 1959 and starred in the movie version two years later. Then came \"Lilies of the Field,\" biblical epic \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" and the drama \"A Patch of Blue,\" in which his character had a chaste romance with a blind white woman. Spurred by his friendship with the more outspoken Belafonte, Poitier also began embracing the civil rights movement. He attended the 1963 March on Washington and in 1964 traveled to Mississippi to meet with activists in the days following the infamous slayings of three young civil rights workers. Sidney Poitier  during a break in filming of \"In the Heat of the Night\" on location in Tennessee on April 11, 1967.  He said the role was one of the most intense he ever played.But Poitier sometimes bristled when interviewers questioned him too much about his experiences with racism. \"Racism was horrendous, but there were other aspects to life,\" he told Winfrey. \"There are those who allow their lives to be defined only by race. I correct anyone who comes at me only in terms of race.\" A year like no other Then came 1967, and one of the most remarkable years any Hollywood star has had before or since. Poitier starred in three high-profile films, starting with \"To Sir, With Love,\" a British drama about an idealistic teacher who must win over rebellious teenagers in a tough East London school. By this time, Poitier was commanding $1 million a movie, and the filmmakers weren't sure they could afford to hire him. So they struck a deal to pay the actor scale -- the minimum legal amount -- in exchange for a percentage of the movie's box-office grosses. Although common in Hollywood today, it was a radical idea at the time -- and a savvy one for Poitier. \"To Sir, With Love\" became a big hit, earning him a huge payday.  Sidney Poitier with  Rod Steiger on the set of \"In the Heat of the Night,\"  directed by Norman Jewison. Next up was Norman Jewison's \"In the Heat of the Night,\" which gave Poitier his most enduring role. He played Virgil Tibbs, a homicide detective passing through Mississippi when he is detained by a bigoted White police chief (Rod Steiger) as a possible suspect in a slaying. Tibbs reluctantly agrees to stay and help solve the case, and the two men eventually find a grudging mutual respect. The movie gave Poitier his most famous line -- \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\" -- an indignant cry for respect after a demeaning slur by Steiger's character.  In another memorable scene, Tibbs is slapped in the face by a racist plantation owner and then slaps him right back. Before agreeing to do the film, Poitier requested a script change to add the retaliatory slap and even rewrote his contract to prohibit the studio from cutting the scene. \"And of course it is one of those great, great moments in all of film, when you slap him back,\" CBS News' Lesley Stahl told Poitier in 2013. He replied, \"Yes, I knew that I would have been insulting every Black person in the world (if I hadn't).\" Poitier followed that film with Stanley Kramer's \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" another message movie about racial tolerance, in which his doctor character must persuade Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn's characters to let him marry their daughter. The movie was released only six months after the Supreme Court made interracial marriage legal in all 50 states. Sidney Poitier with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in a scene from the 1967 film, \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.\"However, around the same time some Black people began grumbling that Poitier's saintly, non-sexualized characters bore little resemblance to the complex realities of African-American life. Black playwright Clifford Mason, in a 1967 New York Times column, argued that Poitier played essentially the same character in every movie: \"a good guy in a totally white world, with no wife, no sweetheart, no woman to love or kiss, helping the white man solve the white man's problem.\" This criticism stung Poitier so much that he retreated to the Bahamas for months. \"I lived through people turning on me. It was painful for a couple years. ... I was the most successful Black actor in the history of the country,\" Poitier told Winfrey. \"The criticism I received was principally because I was usually the only Black in the movies. Personally, I thought that was a step (forward).\" Later he became a director and turned to TV In the 1970s, Poitier scaled back on acting and turned to directing, which he felt gave him more control over his film projects. He teamed up with his pal Belafonte for the Western \"Buck and the Preacher,\" his directorial debut. He directed and co-starred with Bill Cosby in the comedy caper \"Uptown Saturday Night,\" which, along with its spiritual sequels \"Let's Do It Again\" and \"A Piece of the Action,\" featured largely Black casts. And in 1980, he directed \"Stir Crazy,\" the Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder prison-break comedy, which became one of his biggest hits. Sidney Poitier signals to the audience to sit after being presented with a Hall of Fame Tribute at the 32nd Annual NAACP  Image Awards in Los Angeles  in 2001. Although he faded as a big box-office draw, Poitier continued to appear onscreen sporadically into the 1990s, most notably with Tom Berenger in the 1988 action-thriller \"Shoot to Kill,\" with Robert Redford in the 1992 caper film \"Sneakers\" and with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere in 1997's \"The Jackal,\" his final film role. He also belatedly turned to television, where he was nominated for Emmys for playing US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and South African leader Nelson Mandela in two miniseries. He also was considered for the role of President Josiah \"Jed\" Bartlet on TV's \"The West Wing,\" which eventually went to Martin Sheen.  By 2000, Poitier had retired from acting, choosing instead to play golf and pen a memoir, \"The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography,\" in which he described his lifelong attempt to live according to principles instilled in him by his father and others he admired. In his later years, as Hollywood sought to recognize a man whose example had opened doors for so many other Black actors, the accolades poured in. In 2001, Poitier received an honorary Academy Award for his overall contribution to American cinema. The following year, in accepting his best actor Oscar for \"Training Day,\" Denzel Washington said, \"Forty years I've been chasing Sidney. ... I'll always be chasing you, Sidney. I'll always be following in your footsteps.\" Sidney Poitier at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar night party on March 2, 2014, in West Hollywood, California. In 2009, President Obama awarded Poitier the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, saying, \"It's been said that Sidney Poitier does not make movies, he makes milestones ... milestones of artistic excellence, milestones of America's progress.\" The Film Society of Lincoln Center bestowed its highest award on Poitier in 2011. Among the speakers praising him was filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who said, \"In the history of movies, there've only been a few actors who, once they gained recognition, their influence forever changed the art form. \"There's a time before their arrival, and there's a time after their arrival. And after their arrival, nothing's ever going to be the same again.

Traveling inside videogames doesn't always end well cinematically, but this \"Guy\" braves that familiar scenario and comes out ahead.Although there's a bit of \"Ready Player One\" baked into the colorful world that Reynolds' Guy inhabits, a more appropriate (if loftier) spiritual heir would be \"The Truman Show,\" to the extent the central character discovers that the world he's living in is completely artificial, a construct for the amusement of others.Adding a degree of difficulty, Guy is a resident of Free City, a place with an inordinately high crime rate, where working at the bank, as he does, means happily dropping to the floor without even interrupting a conversation with his best pal Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) when someone barges in to rob the place.Guy, it turns out, is a non-playable character in this videogame world, living out the same routine over and over. All that changes, however, when he encounters Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer, an Emmy winner for \"Killing Eve\"), a visitor from the outside who has entered Free City on a very specific mission, and who stirs reactions in Guy that bring him very close to tilt.What's happening here? Getting into that too deeply would spoil the fun, but suffice it to say the avatars in the game world don't bear much resemblance to their real-world counterparts, and that Comer's outside-the-game self, Millie, is at odds with the head of the videogame company (Taika Waititi, amusingly over the top) behind Free City, setting up a threat to Guy's world just as he's rediscovering his place in it.Read MoreDirected by Shawn Levy (\"Night at the Museum\") from a script by Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn (who, yes, wrote \"Ready Player One\"), \"Free Guy\" offers plenty of gamer-specific gags -- as well as a dollop of \"Tron\" in Millie's quest -- but one needn't be immersed in that sphere to appreciate the movie. That's in part because the film exhibits an equally strong grasp of pop culture in general, including several cameos, one of which is so good as to practically be worth the price of admission all by itself.For Reynolds, who has perfected the smart-alecky demeanor of \"Deadpool\" to the point of almost being shackled by it, Guy represents a rather deft expansion -- a character that capitalizes on his leading-man qualities while wrapping him in an innocent, almost-childlike package, since so much of all this is utterly new and foreign to him, which proves oddly endearing.Perhaps inevitably, \"Free Guy\" seeks to run up the entertainment score and would have benefited from saying \"Game over\" a little sooner, but for the most part the film moves briskly, coming to a satisfying conclusion after the protracted chaos leading up to it.The summer movie season has offered a mixed bag, with results further clouded by simultaneous streaming and Covid. \"Free Guy's\" ability to break out from that malaise remains to be seen, but it's such a cheerful, good-natured exercise it deserves to have a long shelf life, whether or not it powers up on this level.\"Free Guy\" premieres in US theaters on Aug. 13.

(CNN)For those needing additional evidence that streaming has thrown a lifeline to movies for grownups, look no further than this weekend, which brings three of them, with two hitting theaters for reasons that have more to do with award requirements than commerce.Each of those films come with the pedigree of having actors behind the camera (a publicity bonus on the talk-show circuit), with George Clooney directing \"The Tender Bar\" (Amazon), an adaptation of journalist J.R. Moehringer's memoir featuring Ben Affleck as the protagonist's colorful uncle; and \"The Lost Daughter\" (Netflix), based on \"My Brilliant Friend\" author Elena Ferrante's book, starring Olivia Colman in the first film directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal.The third, \"Swan Song\" (Apple TV+), presents Mahershala Ali in a classic dual showcase. In a sci-fi concept set about 10 minutes in the future, he plays a dying man who must decide on replacing himself with a perfect replica imbued with all his memories.And it doesn't end there. Christmas Day marks the theatrical release of director Joel Coen's stark black-and-white version of \"The Tragedy of Macbeth,\" starring Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand, something wicked that comes to Apple TV+ on Jan. 14.For streaming services, these movies remain viable as a source of awards prestige and attention (big-name stars help with the latter), without the pressures associated with closely watched box-office opening weekends. Such dramatic fare has struggled at theaters, a dynamic significantly exacerbated by the pandemic, with \"West Side Story's\" theatrical-only opening among the recent releases that have underperformed.Read MoreQualitatively speaking, these movies -- which are all courting award voters and year-end lists -- represent a mixed bag. Here's a brief preview to help decide whether to seek them out, either in theaters or (more likely) at home:The Tender Bar (New York and LA theaters, wide Dec. 22, Jan. 7 on Amazon)Ben Affleck dispenses wisdom to his nephew in director George Clooney's 'The Tender Bar' (Claire Folger/Amazon Content Services).Clooney's film has a folksy feel to it but not much in the way of urgency, following the young J.R. first as a boy and then as a college student played by Tye Sheridan. With his father largely out of the picture, he's partially raised by his colorful uncle and an array of characters at the bar he runs, serving up a showy supporting role for Affleck, whose trending off-screen life at times overshadows his screen accomplishments. It's earnest enough, but a flimsy attraction in the bigger scheme of things.The Lost Daughter (in theaters, Dec. 31 on Netflix)Olivia Colman in Netflix's 'The Lost Daughter.'Olivia Colman stars in this taut little Netflix movie about a woman vacationing alone in an idyllic seaside town, before being drawn into a strange relationship with an unhappily married woman (Dakota Johnson), whose interaction with her young daughter evokes memories in Colman's character of her dark past. (Jessie Buckley plays her in flashbacks.)It's an impressive directing debut by Gyllenhaal, and Colman is worth watching in almost anything, here in a film whose psychological aspects are somewhat offset by a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion.Swan Song (Apple TV+)Mahershala Ali plays a double role in Apple TV+'s 'Swan Song.'Two-time Oscar winner Ali delivers a powerful performance as Cameron, the man facing a terminal illness, in what's otherwise an underdeveloped movie, despite exploring provocative themes about what truly makes us human and how far we'd go -- or what we'd sacrifice -- to spare our loved ones the pain of loss.Naomie Harris and Glenn Close co-star as Cameron's wife and the scientist behind the procedure, respectively, the latter gently him through this process, as he struggles with the decision on whether to go through with it. The film raises all kinds of intriguing ethical questions, without completely working as a drama.The Tragedy of Macbeth (Dec. 25 in theaters, Jan. 14 on Apple TV+)Denzel Washington stars in director Joel Coen's 'The Tragedy of Macbeth.'Shot in arresting black and white, Coen has created a stark and occasionally visceral retelling of Shakespeare's play, which if nothing else is good news for lazy English students.McDormand (the director's wife) has seemingly been playing some variation of Lady Macbeth for a while now, but she and Washington bring considerable intensity to the proceedings and are surrounded by a stellar cast.Granted, there's a \"Why now?\" factor in sitting through another cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare, but the explanation for this title also applies to everything else mentioned here: Talent is drawn to these kind of character-driven, CGI-free movies, and streaming services have the money to spend and the shelves to fill.As for the challenge such films face in theaters, the aforementioned Affleck summed that up well in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, discussing the \"seismic shift\" that had begun even before the pandemic, with people preferring to watch certain kinds of movies on their increasingly excellent screens at home.\"People don't want to go see dramas,\" he said. \"Then the pandemic hit, and ironically, one of the first few films that was rushed to streaming was 'The Way Back,' and people did see it. I said, 'You know what? This isn't bad.' I would rather have people see this and watch it, and I don't need to be stuck to the old ways. ... You have to adapt with the times or you risk becoming a dinosaur.\"For many, that admission is accompanied by a heavy sigh. Yet when it comes to serious dramas migrating to streaming, he's not alone in having resigned himself to going with the flow.Can you smell the Christmas cheer? A scene from the \"Young Rock\" Christmas special. Pictured are: Uli Latukefu, Adrian Groulx, and Bradley Constant.CNN's Sandra Gonzalez with a recommendation from this past week.\"If you missed the 'Young Rock' Christmas special, I highly recommend gathering the kiddos and watching it together. (It's available to stream on Hulu.) In the episode, Dewey -- the youngest version of The Rock portrayed on the show -- learns an important lesson about the meaning of Christmas. I appreciated how a meaningful message was told through the eyes of a young person. So much Christmas fare for kids panders to them, and as 'Home Alone' and other greats have shown us, kids have the capacity to understand so much more than we give them credit for. It's a fun watch for the whole family.\" Missing Great British Bake-Off? \" allowfullscreen>Another weekend recommendation from Sandra.\"During a Holiday Cheer Zoom, my colleague Radhika Marya suggested that I try 'The Great Pottery Throw Down' because I was going through 'Great British Bake-Off' withdrawal. I'm pleased to report that the show, which has had four seasons, delivered. Similar to 'GBBO,' the show is like micro-dosing soothing joy. What I enjoy most about these shows is the enthusiasm that people show for their crafts. In a time when we're often too quick to mock anything or anyone who is too earnest (see: that Jeremy Strong profile), I say give me more of people being proud and passionate about what they love.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "6", "day": "10"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Big and vibrant, \"In the Heights\" provides summer movie-going with a joyous jolt of adrenalin, wedding the sensibilities of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical with \"Crazy Rich Asians\" director Jon M.

", "full_article_text": " (CNN)Big and vibrant, \"In the Heights\" provides summer movie-going with a joyous jolt of adrenalin, wedding the sensibilities of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical with \"Crazy Rich Asians\" director Jon M. Chu's mouth-watering imagery. Throw in a dazzling cast, and Warner Bros. has gifted audiences with what feels like just the ticket to jog them out of their pandemic doldrums -- maybe all the way to a theater.Of course, there's no certainty in that, since the studio (like CNN, a part of WarnerMedia) will continue its practice of simultaneously dropping the film on HBO Max. Whatever the size of the screen, the result is a movie whose old-fashioned charms practically leap off of it, and whose tunes will follow many around for days on end.The Tony Award-winning musical made its debut in 2008 with Miranda in the cast, in what amounted to a down payment for the blockbuster to come with \"Hamilton.\" The story here, though, has less to do with the country's origins than the author's, focusing on a New York neighborhood, Washington Heights, and the strivers and dreamers (including Dreamers, literally) trying to make it there.Although Miranda has taken only a small role in the film, the lead passes to \"Hamilton\" co-star Anthony Ramos, who, with his simultaneous stint in HBO's \"In Treatment,\" seems poised to come out of this summer an even bigger star than he was heading into it. He plays Usnavi, the story's narrator, presenting a fable about the neighborhood to a group of smiling children.Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera in the musical 'In the Heights.'The story finds him running the local bodega, trying to make ends meet while pining for Vanessa (Melissa Barrera), who has her own aspirations to escape and become a fashion designer. The other key couple shares a past, with Nina (Leslie Grace) coming home from Stanford, uncertain about whether she belongs, and Benny (Corey Hawkins) working for Nina's father (Jimmy Smits), who is so proud of his daughter's accomplishments he doesn't hear her concerns.Read MoreThe neighborhood itself, meanwhile, is changing, threatening its everybody-knows-your-name charm with gentrification. Usnavi is contemplating a break too, heading back to his native Dominican Republic, although the prospect of romance has a way of complicating even the best-laid plans.The simplicity of the tale belies the intoxicating nature of the music, from lovely ballads to a showstopping Busby Berkeley-style rendition of \"96,000\" at the local pool and a beautifully choreographed homage to Fred Astaire. Throughout, the movie bursts with energy and color, with shrewd casting choices from top to bottom, perhaps especially with Grace (a singer making her movie debut) and Barrera (who co-starred in the Starz series \"Vida\").As it happens, \"In the Heights\" kicks off an unusually well-populated lineup of movie musicals this year thanks in part to the logjam created by Covid, with \"Annette\" (which will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival), \"West Side Story,\" \"Dear Evan Hansen\" and \"Everybody's Talking About Jamie\" all still to come.Those films remain unseen, but in terms of fulfilling the promise of its material and setting a high bar, audiences will be well served indeed if any of them manage to scale these \"Heights.\"\"In the Heights\" premieres June 11 in theaters and on HBO Max. It's rated PG-13."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "9", "day": "4"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "\"The Boys\" quickly became Amazon's signature series, and the second season of this beyond-dark show outdoes the first -- offering a searing take on modern-day America that might be TV's most subversive program, camouflaged in superhero garb.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)\"The Boys\" quickly became Amazon's signature series, and the second season of this beyond-dark show outdoes the first -- offering a searing take on modern-day America that might be TV's most subversive program, camouflaged in superhero garb.What could be more terrifying than a psychopathic Superman? That's a central facet of \"The Boys,\" which hits the ground running at extraordinary speed (appropriately), while dealing with the notion of evil hiding behind patriotic platitudes and wrapped in a cape.For those who might have skipped season one, spoilers lie ahead if you're thinking about catching up. Broadly, the series remains divided into warring camps, each with its own internal politics, squabbles and issues, presented with jaw-dropping levels of violence (superheroes can cause a lot of carnage when unleashed) and disarming humor.The opening arc closed with Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), the ill-tempered leader of the ordinary mortals opposing the superheroes, learning startling news about the wife he thought he had lost.The super-team The Seven, meanwhile, is in a state of flux, grappling with dysfunction inside its ranks and tensions regarding the corporation, Vought International, which oversees and profits from it. In season two, that includes shooting a movie starring the heroes to further buff up their carefully managed image, which cheekily references a \"Joss\" rewrite.Read MoreThe season-one casualties allow for some terrific new players, including Vought's unflappable boss (Giancarlo Esposito, who somehow seems to be everywhere at once) and Stormfront (Aya Cash), who fills a vacancy in The Seven and quickly shakes up the intra-squad dynamics.The most severe threat, however, remains the mercurial Homelander (Antony Starr), the living personification of the corrupting nature of power -- in this case, quite literally -- who seeks to exert greater control over the team.\"Gods\" should not have to feel pain, he says, adding, \"Because that is what we are. ... We can do anything we want, and no one can stop us. That's a good feeling.\" As noted, \"The Boys\" incorporates amusing real-world and pop-culture references (someone on the writing staff seems pretty obsessed with \"Hamilton\"), but in a broader sense, the show is informed by a deep cynicism about how the public can be manipulated and lead down the creeping path toward fascism. While these themes arose during the first season, showrunner Eric Kripke and company have sharpened them, in a way that feels especially pointed and relevant.The plot has also become denser over these eight episodes, including the sweet if awkward relationship between Hughie (Jack Quaid), the unlikely foe of the Seven, and Starlight (Erin Moriarty), the hero who has witnessed its corruption up close and personal. Adapted from a popular comic, \"The Boys\" premiered last year amid a wave of revisionist superhero fare, including HBO's \"Watchmen\" and streaming alternatives \"The Umbrella Academy\" and \"Doom Patrol.\" Clearly, expanding the lens beyond the most popular Marvel and DC fare is having its TV moment, at the risk of saturation.Still, this series manages not only to be exciting and unpredictable but to examine the perils of hero worship in a manner that's mind-blowing in more ways than one, and incidentally, absolutely not for the squeamish.Amazon has already renewed the show for a third season and ordered an after-show devoted to discussing it, signs of its perceived appeal and importance to the service. While the term \"hit\" gets thrown around too freely in regard to streaming, with its deft mesh cultural and political satire, \"The Boys\" has earned its place at the head of the class. \"The Boys\" second season premieres Sept. 4 on Amazon."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2015", "month": "8", "day": "31"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Wes Craven, the filmmaker who defined the horror genre with the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise and later redefined it with \"Scream,\" has died.

In 2016, the Washington Post declared it dead again -- in 2019, Variety did so as well. Now, in an era of streaming and superhero movies, the romantic comedy has been largely cast aside by traditional Hollywood studios putting out theatrical releases. Nevertheless, the genre of meet-cutes and airport scenes, sweeping kisses and witty one-liners, has persisted in various forms.What exactly is a rom-com?The romantic comedy is a movie grappling with couple formation, said Maria San Filippo, an associate professor at Emerson College and editor of the collection \"After 'Happily Ever After': Romantic Comedy in the Post-Romantic Age.\"Tonally, these movies tend to be a bit more carefree and optimistic than other movies that might deal with similar topics (such as \"Marriage Story,\"  which San Filippo called a drama).Romantic comedies have long been a staple of Hollywood, and though they've become a misogynistic punchline in recent years, that wasn't always the case. In 1934, \"It Happened One Night\" -- credited often as the first screwball comedy, a subgenre of rom-com films -- swept all five of the Academy Awards it was nominated for: best director, actor, actress, adaptation and outstanding production (now known as best picture). It was the first film to sweep all the \"Big Five\" awards, a feat that has only been repeated twice.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert starred in \"It Happened One Night,\" a 1934 movie that swept the Oscars.Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert's unlikely tumble into love led to the production of dozens of similar screwball comedies, launching one of the most memorable eras of romantic comedies. Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were at the peak of their powers -- there was shouting, rowdy one-upmanship, and of course, love!

Also, it's directed by Steven Soderbergh, so you know it's good.Hide Caption 11 of 11Though elements of these movies live on, classic screwball comedies fizzled out by the mid-1940s. Decades later, Woody Allen's landmark 1977 film \"Annie Hall\" explored similar themes of romance and couple formation even though (spoiler alert) its main characters do not end the movie rushing into each other's arms -- a departure from earlier norms. Though the movie is undoubtedly a romantic comedy, it's one that subverts the usual tropes in favor of something a little messier, maybe a little more real -- Allen's complicated legacy aside, it marks a notable shift in tone for the genre. For those keeping score, the film took home four Academy Awards, including best picture.After that, \"neo-traditional\" romantic comedies took hold, led by the hilarious bickering of Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally\" (nominated for best original screenplay at the Oscars).These neo-traditional romantic comedies are now what most people think of when referencing the genre. It's \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Four Weddings and Funeral.\" It's Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron; it's Katherine Heigl and Matthew McConnaughey.These movies -- to varying degrees of success -- typically follow a formula: White heterosexual boy meets White heterosexual girl, problems and hilarity ensue. In Black romantic comedies, like \"Brown Sugar\" or \"Two Can Play That Game,\" the formula is more or less the same.It's easy to dismiss the formula, said John Alberti, a professor of English at Northern Kentucky University who has written extensively about the genre. But when it's done well, it feels like Heath Ledger belting \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" while dancing across the bleachers -- joyous magic.\"Romantic comedies are dealing with the fundamental aspects of human existence: Desire, love, loneliness,\" Alberti said. \"Unlike (for example), 'Fast and Furious,' most of us are not going to become world class street racers, but most people do aspire to being in relationships, and take that very seriously.\"After all, who hasn't breathed a sigh of relief watching two people find their way to each other? Who hasn't wiped a tear away after a heartfelt \"I love you\" speech? These movies pull at our heart strings, by appealing to one of our most basic wants -- to be loved.Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal starred in \"When Harry Met Sally,\" launching the neotraditionalist era of the romantic comedy.But something happened over the years, between the wild commercial and critical successes of movies like \"Annie Hall\" and \"When Harry Met Sally,\" to the largely bland offerings of the early to mid-2000s. The movies simply became redundant, with their over-reliance on cliches, content to deliver the same story with (slightly) different faces and little chemistry. Take \"The Ugly Truth,\" a 2009 film starring Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl. In a New York Times review of the movie, longtime critic Manohla Dargis begins the article with a damning statement.\"That tap-tap-tapping sound you hear,\" she writes, \"is another nail being driven into the coffin of the romantic comedy.\"They used to be hits. What happened?Part of the reason romantic comedies became so redundant is studio demand for content that could be aimed at a broad audience, said San Filippo. As a result, the movies became \"incredibly White, incredibly heteronormative.\"For a long time, those movies were successful -- they were cheap to make and brought in huge profits.\"My Best Friend's Wedding,\" a 1997 movie starring Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz, was made on a  $38 million budget, but worldwide, the movie brought in more than $299 million. \"Pretty Woman,\" (1990) with Roberts and Richard Gere, was made on a miniscule $14 million budget, but brought in a whopping $463.4 million worldwide. Even as late as 2009, \"The Proposal,\" starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, was made on a budget of $40 million and grossed $317.3 million worldwide. These were \"mega, mega movies,\" said media analyst Karie Bible. But as the years went on, they simply stopped making as much money.Richard Gere and Julia Roberts\nclicked in \"Pretty Woman,\" a 1990 romantic comedy movie that became a massive hit. \"That was magic,\" Bible said.Just one year before the smashing success of \"The Proposal,\" \"Fool's Gold,\" starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, only grossed $111 million worldwide on a $70 million budget.More recently, 2019's Rebel Wilson-led \"Isn't It Romantic\" made a mere $48 million worldwide on a $31 million budget.These numbers hardly hold a candle to the romantic comedies of yore. And there's a lot of reasons that could be to blame, Bible said. Finding stars that actually have chemistry is no easy task, let alone finding a script that works. \"Julia and Richard, that was magic,\" she said. But it doesn't happen often.Studios have also moved away from mid-budget movies, Alberti noted -- a trend that's affected romantic comedies as well as melodramas. Instead, studios have focused on investing in giant blockbusters, like superhero movies. And after years of being force-fed mediocre romantic comedies, audiences are changing, too.The genre has long been written off as \"chick flicks\" unworthy of serious consideration, by audiences and critics alike. At the same time, some have tired of the played-out notion that a woman's life is incomplete if she's single (an idea, common in post-2000 movies, that the 2016 romantic comedy \"How To Be Single\" attempted to subvert). And many are no longer content to see the same White faces, as people of color or LGBTQ people are relegated to roles of \"sassy best friend\" or therapist.Furthermore, San Filippo noted that culture writ large has become \"post-romantic,\" as more and more people become disillusioned with ideas of love, marriage or monogamy.Altogether, these shifting dynamics have led to the demise of the romantic comedy -- at least as we've traditionally known it.But that doesn't mean the genre has been buried just yet.Where is the romantic comedy now?Romantic comedies, San Filippo said, tend to be narrowly defined -- often considered to be chick flicks and nothing more. This narrow definition of the genre, combined with the fact that the films are also most often targeted toward women, feeds into the idea that they are better left dead, she said. And, if the movie is actually good -- critically acclaimed or widely lauded -- it's less likely to even be called a romantic comedy in the first place, San Filippo said, pointing to films such as 2013's \"Her.\" Still, many movies can actually be interpreted as romantic comedies in disguise: Movies like \"Wonder Woman 1984,\" the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and even \"Tenet\" all have elements of romance and comedy in them and incorporate some aspect of couple formation into their storylines. That said, just because traditional Hollywood studios have moved away from formulaic romantic comedies, doesn't mean the demand for those movies has disappeared. The demand, as Netflix and other streaming sites have shown, is very much there.Most streaming services do not make the numbers for their content readily available, but it's no secret that Netflix has become a leading producer of the genre and probably one of the largest producers of romantic comedy movies, Alberti said. The trend has to do with the nichification of streaming, he said. Whereas traditional movie studios wanted to reach as broad of an audience as possible, streaming websites like Netflix are attempting to appeal to very specific audiences through algorithms -- a strategy that requires having lots of content within a specific genre. That's why it may seem like Netflix or other streaming sites are creating the bulk of the romantic comedy movies.Netflix has \"The Kissing Booth 2\" and \"To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You.\" HBO Max has \"Superintelligence.\" Hulu has \"Palm Springs\" and \"Happiest Season.\" These were just the movies released in 2020.In \"Happiest Season,\" released on Hulu in 2020, Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart starred as a couple going home for the holidays for the first time.But these films largely follow the traditional romantic comedy structure and contain many of the same tropes (boy meets girl, an airport scene, a sassy best friend). Though they may be more diverse than the romantic comedies of the past, they aren't necessarily doing anything new, in the way that some might say the movies of the past did. In some cases, they're simply mediocre -- or just filler.That's where TV series come in -- the place where the genre is seemingly being pushed forward. Where movies are typically capped around two hours, series can go on for multiple episodes or seasons, allowing space to ask deeper questions about romance, love and couple formation. San Filippo used HBO Max's \"Made For Love\" as an example, a show that forces its audience to think about what romance could look like in the future, asking questions like whether it's possible to fall in love with machines. (CNN and HBO Max share parent company WarnerMedia.)\"The classical romantic comedy plot is very end-point driven,\" Alberti said, pointing to the ways in which movies focus solely on the couple actually getting together or making it to the wedding. \"With a serial, you can get into the idea of a relationship as a process.\"That means looking beyond the happily ever after and instead exploring the more challenging parts of being in a relationship. Netflix's \"Easy\" and Amazon Prime's \"Modern Love\" are indicative of the evolving genre. Both shows explore the messier aspects of pursuing love and sex, from open relationships to gender roles in sex. Unlike many traditional romantic comedies, both refrain from fantasy, choosing instead to remain grounded in the real world. Even Hulu's serial remake of \"High Fidelity,\" which retained a rather classic romantic comedy structure, still managed to feel fresh, allowing Zoe Kravitz the space to portray a chaotic and selfish main character whose anxieties about relationships and growing old many young Millennials could relate to.Ed Helms (left) and Patti Harrison starred in 2021's \"Together Together.\"This isn't to say that films are not pushing the genre at all: 2021's \"Together Together,\" starring Patti Harrison and Ed Helms as a surrogate and single father navigating the boundaries surrounding their relationship, hits many of the same notes of a romantic comedy -- without the traditional romance aspect. In its place is something platonic, though still tender and affectionate. Along with culture shifts -- creating space to question monogamy, marriage or even romance itself -- romantic comedies, especially the serial ones, become more interesting, San Filippo said. It takes the genre beyond simply wish-fulfillment (\"Will the cute guy love me back?\") and into the realm of reality.6 ways 'Never Have I Ever' busts Asian stereotypesOf course, the formula is a formula for a reason, and it probably won't disappear any time soon.But increasingly, romantic comedies are no longer limited to escapist wish-fulfillment fantasies.They can also be thought-provoking, like Netflix's \"Love,\" or quietly devastating like \"The Half Of It.\" They might make viewers question their own relationship, or think differently about love and sex. They may reveal the inherent romance in non-romantic relationships or reveal a larger world view -- like \"Ted Lasso\" did with \"Rainbow.\" They might even question if it really exists.None of this means the romantic comedy is dead. If anything, it's been reborn.

Premiering on Disney+, Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical beautifully survives the transfer process, with a few minor hiccups. Some will lament not seeing the movie in theaters, but given its length and the goodwill generated for Disney's streaming service, the studio hasn't thrown away its shot.Basically, the equation on \"Hamilton\" boils down to this: If you've never seen the musical, this filmed production -- shot over three days in 2016, then edited together -- offers the chance to enjoy it with the original cast. If you have seen it, it's a welcome opportunity to bask in all that talent and brilliance again.As a bonus, the production technique -- which combines a performance taped in front of an audience with separately shot close-ups and camera angles that put the viewer on the stage -- goes beyond the \"best seat in the house\" to a more cinematic experience.So where are the drawbacks? Chalk them up as quibbles: Watching at home, the audience response can at times be a trifle distracting. Ditto for some of the lighting, which, as captured, occasionally casts an eerie blue glow onto the performers.Beyond that, sit back, relax, mute your phone and enjoy the show, which runs two hours and 42 minutes (including a one-minute \"intermission\"). Bringing history spectacularly to life, Miranda's dazzling mix of musical genres presents the triumphant and tumultuous life of Alexander Hamilton, the founding father whom he portrays.Read MoreLin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr. in 'Hamilton.'Seeing them reunited now, the cast that the producers originally assembled is even more remarkable: Leslie Odom Jr. as the \"damn fool who shot him,\" Aaron Burr; Daveed Diggs (Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson); Christopher Jackson (George Washington); Phillipa Soo as Hamilton's wife, Eliza, and Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry as her sister Angelica; and Jonathan Groff as mad King George, only here with the camera zooming in so you can see spittle spray during his exasperated moments in the comedic masterpiece \"You'll Be Back.\"Lest anyone has forgotten, Miranda's Tony-winning book and score contain one gem after another, yielding no shortage of spine-tingling moments. Pick a favorite, although Soo and Goldsberry's back-to-back renditions of \"Helpless\" and \"Satisfied\" and Odom's \"The Room Where It Happens\" are hard to top. If anything, at-home consumption offers a few conspicuous advantages, including the ability to consume the lengthy show at one's leisure. Miranda and director Thomas Kail taped an introduction to the film acknowledging its shift to Disney+, which required sacrificing a couple of swear words to satisfy Disney's standards, but otherwise, this is \"Hamilton,\" full strength.Sorting out how well that translates to the studio's bottom line remains a pricklier proposition, but the publicity for Disney+ alone has considerable benefits. Moreover, the movie caters to a theater-hungry audience with Broadway shuttered and might appeal to a contingent of fans who are indifferent to the service's principal brands -- specifically, \"Star Wars,\" Marvel and kids fare.Granted, nothing can fully replicate the unique qualities of a live theatrical experience. But if anyone doubts that \"Hamilton\" can still deliver a Broadway wallop to the comfort of one's couch, well, just you wait.\"Hamilton\" premieres July 3 on Disney+. It's rated PG-13."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "8", "day": "5"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "After putting the wind in \"Moana's\" sails with his music and lyrics, Lin-Manuel Miranda brings his stage-honed chops to another animated movie in \"Vivo,\" a sweet if slight love story built around an inordinately resourceful kinkajou.

Premiering on Netflix, Miranda's songs elevate a small-boned effort -- call it cute, without that being pejorative -- with an unabashedly romantic streak.The title kinkajou (voiced by Miranda) has been raised in Cuba by a street performer, Andr\u00e9s (Juan de Marcos), who reveals his long unpursued love for musical star Marta Sandoval (Gloria Estefan), who is planning a farewell concert in Miami.An unforeseen turn leaves Vivo seeking to fulfill Andr\u00e9s' wishes by embarking on a seemingly impossible mission for a rainforest \"honey bear\" with big cartoon eyes, journeying to Miami to deliver to Marta the love song that Andr\u00e9s wrote for her decades earlier.As with most such quests, the furry musician gets help from a variety of unexpected sources, most significantly a nerdy outcast named Gabi (newcomer Ynairaly Simo), who has lost her father, and whose antics (including a track record of deceased pets) has her poor mother (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) at her wits' end.The trip to Miami, however, experiences several detours, including one through the Everglades, which mostly feels like a laborious attempt to introduce more animal friends (and foes) while prolonging the modest journey to feature length.Read MoreWritten by Quiara Alegria Hudes (Miranda's collaborator on \"In the Heights\"), and directed by Kirk DeMicco (\"The Croods\") and co-director Brandon Jeffords, \"Vivo\" comes from Sony's animation arm, which produced the \"Hotel Transylvania\" series but hardly possesses Disney's storied legacy. Even so, the songs -- featuring the composer's trademark mix of musical styles and playful lyrical calisthenics -- prove catchy and touching, particularly in Andres' words about sharing Marta, who was destined for bigger things, with the world.Netflix has sought to diversify its menu with children's fare, a something-for-every-demographic strategy -- in cultural terms with the recent \"Over the Moon\" as well as age -- that has yielded mixed creative dividends.Animation provides Miranda -- who is also writing songs for Disney's upcoming \"Encanto\" -- and Hudes a colorful canvas to extend their collaboration, albeit at a scale that won't make anyone forget about \"Hamilton.\" Still, by continuing to explore a medium that has a long musical history, Miranda's not throwing away his shots.\"Vivo\" premieres Aug. 6 on Netflix."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "9", "day": "23"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Despite its Broadway credentials, \"Dear Evan Hansen\" hits screens faced with an inherent tension: Can its songs and cast, led by Ben Platt reprising his Tony-winning role, overcome the uncomfortable premise and problematic protagonist?

The answer is not completely, despite tweaks seemingly made specifically to try softening those edges.Although one might think an acclaimed musical wouldn't warrant such concerns, the nature of the story -- about a misunderstanding that becomes a lie, at first kind in its intentions but increasingly cruel as it drags on -- won't be for everyone. And while there are a few beautiful songs from the team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (\"La La Land\" and \"The Greatest Showman\"), at points that feels like modest compensation for watching this slow-motion train wreck unfold.At its core, the story does say profound things about the nature of grief and mental health, and perhaps most pointedly how people frequently respond to tragedy in ways that make the aftermath all about them. In this case, that tendency transforms an alienated high-school kid no one paid any attention into a cause and crusade after his death.Still, what spoke to people in the theater is diffused through the medium of film. Even with efforts to address some of those issues -- tinkering with the ending, adding new songs to enhance certain characters and excising old ones -- the focus remains squarely on Platt's Evan, who fills in gaps in his troubled life at the expense of everyone around him.\"I wish that anything I said mattered to anyone,\" Evan grumbles in his halting manner early on, writing letters addressed to himself as an exercise suggested by his therapist, which doesn't help in any appreciable way.Read MoreBut then one of those letters is snatched away by Connor (Colton Ryan), who also signs the cast on Evan's arm. When Connor takes his own life, his parents (Amy Adams and Danny Pino) assume that the \"Dear Evan Hansen\" note they found reveals a friendship about which they didn't know.Ben Platt in the movie adaptation of the musical 'Dear Evan Hansen.'Evan goes along, then begins building on the lie. In what feels a bit like \"The Music Man,\" the deception -- and self-deception -- works for a while, helping those grieving while transforming Evan from a friendless outcast into an object of sympathy at first, and eventually lifting his status. Even the seemingly perfect girl (Amandla Stenberg) admits her own self-doubts, while Evan now has an excuse to spend time with Connor's sister Zoe (\"Unbelievable's\" Kaitlyn Dever, maybe the best thing in the film), someone to whom he could never muster the courage to speak before.Yet Evan's remastered life is built on a house of cards. Director Stephen Chbosky (\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\"), working from playwright Steven Levenson's script, wrings as much angst as he can out of that scenario, but at a certain point the plot feels as if it's spinning its wheels.In a year heavy on musicals, the movie also lacks many show-stopping numbers, with the exception being Platt's rendition of \"You Will Be Found,\" Evan's school-assembly speech, an anthem that virally reaches others hurting in the way that Connor had been.What the film can't effectively do is help the audience identify with Evan, who gains relationships he lacked through Connor's family at the potential expense of them, his single mom (Julianne Moore) and peers who have invested in his elaborate fable.Some early criticism has felt like nitpicking (yes, older actors sometimes play high-school students), but the root problems are harder to escape. It's also difficult not to compare this adaptation with Apple TV+'s filmed version of another 2017 Tony nominee, \"Come From Away,\" which preserves its power in a way this movie doesn't.On the plus side, anyone who wanted to see \"Dear Evan Hansen\" on stage now has a chance, with the original star. Yet while the film says something that matters, for a show whose press notes proclaim it a \"generation-defining Broadway phenomenon,\" a great deal appears to have been lost in translation.\"Dear Evan Hansen\" premieres in US theaters on Sept. 24.

While there's obvious calculation in that -- hey, let's be sure to appeal to boys as well as girls -- it temporarily knocks the movie off course, before \"Moana\" regains the wind at its back as it cruises to the finish.Moana (newcomer Auli'i Cravalho) grows up in an idyllic Polynesian island paradise, where the only rule laid down by her father is not to venture beyond the reef. But his daughter yearns to explore, which she announces in a song titled \"How Far I'll Go\" (not to be confused with \"Frozen's\" \"Let It Go\"), the kind of show-stopping anthem that, with Cravalho's soaring belt, would bring a legit theater crowd to its feet.As it turns out, Moana has a good reason to get out and see the world, and not just because her sage old grandma urges her to do so. That's because the aforementioned Maui stole the heart of the island goddess Te Fiti, and the island her people call home will essentially shrivel and die if Moana can't locate Maui and convince him to join her on a perilous journey that will involve, among other things, facing off against a giant lava monster.Read MoreThe ornate mythology of it all -- in a film directed by the teams behind \"The Princess and the Frog\" and \"Big Hero Six,\" and that credits its story to seven writers -- risks becoming a trifle overwhelming exposition-wise. There's also a certain rote quality to the impediments thrown at Moana and Maui as they traverse the ocean bickering, as much killing time before the climax as allowing the two to bond.What makes it work, ultimately, is an intoxicating blend of music and sweeping, luminous vistas. Infused with magic throughout, even the ocean serves as a key character, while Moana blossoms into about as brave and plucky a heroine as any Disney has produced.As a bonus, \"Moana\" is also paired with one of Disney's best recent shorts, \"Inner Workings,\" which chronicles the age-old battle between our hearts and our heads with remarkably efficiency. (Disclosure: My wife works for a division of the studio.)Disney's marketing for the movie promotes its \"Frozen\" lineage, although catching the sort of massive wave that blockbuster rode three years ago seems unlikely.Overall, though, this is a wholly satisfying family movie, released at a time when people are probably hungry for one. So even if \"Moana\" is occasionally guilty of treading water, Disney's latest animated voyage goes far enough as a feast for the eyes and ears to give fans plenty for which to be thankful.\"Moana\" opens November 23 in the U.S. It's rated PG."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "12", "day": "14"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "After the lengthy buildup, array of teases and alleged leaks, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" impressively lives up to the hype, delivering the kind of unabashed big-screen fun for which theaters have been hungering.

Briskly balancing a dizzying assortment of parts, Marvel's latest (by way of Sony) looks destined to do what only a spider can -- namely, lure vast numbers of fans into its web.Perhaps foremost, this third entry in the series (again directed by Jon Watts) is extremely funny, while providing enough callbacks to the character's screen history to qualify as a graduate-level course on the subject. The extent to which viewers come armed with that knowledge will surely enhance their enjoyment, but the movie has been structured carefully enough that two decades of Spider-Man viewing isn't necessarily a prerequisite.Picking up where the previous \"Far From Home\" left off, poor Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has had his identity revealed, throwing his life into utter chaos. That includes being hounded by the Daily Bugle's J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons), whose crusading shtick has received an identifiable upgrade for the digital age.Marvel is understandably vigilant about spoilers, but enough has been made public that it's safe to say the plot deals with complications associated with the multiverse and an errant spell cast by Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), to whom a desperate Peter has turned for help.Strange can't hide his irritation, but as he notes, for all that Peter has weathered, \"You're just a kid.\"Read MoreIf ever a movie made the case for the adage \"Be careful what you wish for,\" it's this one, as Strange's ostensible solution unleashes dire consequences and threats.There's always a degree of messiness when venturing into areas like time travel or alternate universes, but \"No Way Home\" largely powers through that, sprinkling enough wit and warmth to gloss over the inconsistencies.The film also deftly builds upon its predecessors, with more mature relationships between Peter, MJ (Zendaya) and his pal Ned (Jacob Batalon) as their concerns advance from high school to applying to colleges, an already stressful time made all the more so by Peter's elevation to a level of scrutiny normally reserved for British royalty.Holland has grown with the role as well, and Sony was certainly wise to negotiate the 2015 deal that allowed Marvel's Kevin Feige to put his creative stamp on the franchise, enriching the character in ways that go well beyond his association with the Avengers.Frankly, the constant chatter about spoilers and those obsessed with unearthing them (a particularly odd quadrant of the fan universe) will be moot soon enough, leaving the movie's wrinkles to be exhaustively analyzed. After all, Jameson isn't the only one to capitalize on Spider-Man as a reliable driver of web traffic. What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed. And in what has become an increasingly elusive phenomenon, that will include whoops and hollers from appreciative fans in theaters, where \"Spider-Man\" will first reveal its secrets, and then, more than likely, shows off its legs.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" premieres in US theaters on Dec. 17.

Men?There's a lot of buzz around \"Spider-Man: No Way Home.\" Will that buzz turn into box office records?The film \u2014 which cost $200 million to make \u2014 is opening in more 4,300 theaters. Those theaters have scored their biggest pre-ticket sales since \"Avengers: Endgame\" in 2019, according to Fandango. In fact, the film overloaded websites when tickets went on pre-sale last month.Spider-Man is among Marvel's most popular characters, the most powerful franchise in all of Hollywood. 2002's \"Spider-Man\" arguably kicked off the blockbuster superhero era we're in right now by opening to a then record $114.8 million. Since then, films starring the character \u2014 played by multiple actors \u2014 have made more than $6.3 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore (SCOR).\"Peter Parker is the every-person who anyone can identify with,\" Robbins added. \"That's always made the character and his embrace of the Spider-Man persona relatable to people from all backgrounds and walks of life... Young or old, everyone can see part of themselves in Spider-Man.\"And \"No Way Home\" may have more than one Spider-Man.'Spider-Man: No Way Home' finds the sweet spot in Marvel's multiverseRumors have circulated that former Spider-Man actors \u2014 Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield \u2014 could join Holland in the new film. This would make sense since trailers for the films have shown Holland battling villains like Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus and Jamie Foxx's Electro, who were from Maguire and Garfield's films. In fact, that's pretty much the whole plot of the film. Peter Parker asks Doctor Strange to help him reset reality after Parker's secret identity is found out. Doctor Strange obliges, reality collapses, and villains of old show up to take on the web-slinger. So if old villains show up, why not old heroes?Rumors of previous Spider-(Mans? Men?) joining the fight have been shot down, but the possibility alone has sent fans into a nostalgic frenzy. That's led to the type of ticket sales we've been seeing for the film.\"There's an added urgency to see this specific movie for fear of being spoiled and missing out,\" Robbins said. \"'No Way Home' has truly tapped into the cultural zeitgeist in a way that no movie has for the last two years.\"With great power, comes great box office returns\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is the movie theaters needs right now.This year has included many big hits, such as \"A Quiet Place, Part II,\" \"F9: The Fast Saga\" and \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\" Each of those films helped bring audiences back to theaters at a time when streaming became a dominant form of how to watch big movies and amid a ever-changing global health crisis.\"No Way Home\" is exclusive to theaters, so the only way to watch it \u2014 at least for the time being \u2014 is on the big screen.

Since May, the Russos have been hosting an online program titled \"Russo Bros. Pizza Film School.\" They assign movies to fans for discussion, with the objective being \"to educate and spread some love to favorite classic films, as well as local pizzerias while movie lovers are stuck at home.\"The two use the program to showcase movies that impacted them or that they simply admire -- titles such as \"The Evil Dead,\" \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"No Country for Old Men\" -- and invite guests to weigh in on the films. In this week's edition, which is devoted to the 1980 version of \"Flash Gordon,\" they will be joined by Taika Waititi, who directed \"Jojo Rabbit\" and \"Thor: Ragnarok.\"In an interview with CNN, Joe Russo said the idea was suggested by his daughter, as he showed the family movies to pass the time during the early stages of staying at home.

And as is customary with any major hit, that raises questions about when -- or whether -- another network sitcom will blow up this way again.Chuck Lorre, who co-created the show with Bill Prady, has at times seemed like he's single-handedly keeping the traditional multi-camera sitcom alive. In addition to producing \"Two and a Half Men,\" another huge hit for CBS, his credits include the returning \"Mom,\" as well as earlier shows like \"Cybill\" and \"Dharma & Greg.\"More recently, however, Lorre has migrated into single-camera comedies, including the \"Big Bang\" spinoff \"Young Sheldon\" -- already renewed by CBS for two more seasons -- and \"The Kominsky Method,\" the Michael Douglas-Alan Arkin comedy for Netflix, which earned the producer a Golden Globe Award in January.Despite his experimentation with a different form of storytelling, Lorre said he's been around long enough to see the sitcom pronounced dead before -- such as when \"Friends\" signed off 15 years ago -- only to see it rise again. And he continues to operate in that realm, including a new CBS series, \"Bob \u2764\ufe0f Abishola,\" which reunites him with \"Mike & Molly\" star Billy Gardell.Chuck Lorre \"I've been doing this long enough to know I've heard the bold statement that 'This is it. This won't happen again' many times,\" he told CNN. \"And it does. So humility would suggest that making a blanket statement, that this is the end, is probably foolish.\"Read MoreEven in a streaming age, Lorre sees value in the format, which he has described as like producing a little play every week.\"I don't see any reason to walk away from the four-camera show,\" he said. \"It's a valid way to tell a story. When you're at home watching television, you're not counting cameras. You're either entertained or you're not.\"Lorre conceded that he faced a \"sharp learning curve\" in producing single-camera shows, as well as producing for Netflix, where all the episodes become available at once. On the plus side, there were no limitations about episode length, no writing to commercial breaks (usually pharmaceutical ads these days, he quipped) and no restrictions on language. \"You feel like if you need to use a certain word, that word's available to you,\" he said.The main difference, Lorre said, is that a studio audience provides comedy writers instant feedback as to how well their jokes are landing, noting that \"their silence is the sound of failure.\"As a result, sitcoms are often rewritten on the fly when material isn't working. The absence of an audience thus forces writers to rely on and be more trusting of their own judgment.Regular watchers of \"Big Bang\" and Lorre's other shows know that he shares his thoughts -- about everything from politics to growing older to random observations -- on his vanity cards, penning short messages that viewers (those with DVRs, anyway) can freeze and read.Lately, Lorre's cards have taken a rather somber turn, reflecting his distaste for the Trump administration and concerns about the direction of the country.Lorre said there's a certain level of \"cognitive dissonance\" between his job -- trying to make people laugh -- and his general mood and broader concerns.\"There has been a pall lately,\" he said. \"You drive to Burbank every day to write and produce comedy, and there's this foreboding sense that this country is in dire jeopardy, and I'm going to go write a sitcom today.\"Still, even with \"The Big Bang  Theory\" fading to black, for Lorre, the beat, and the jokes, go on.\"The Big Bang Theory\" finale airs May 16 at 8 p.m. on CBS.

All of this is great for fans, who cannot wait to see McGregor return and discover what made the character into the Obi-Wan they met in 1977's \"Star Wars.\" And it's a big deal for Disney, which has put most of its eggs in the Disney+ basket.\"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" is the kind of series that should bring in a trove of subscribers while keeping those who already signed up very happy. Disney+ currently has nearly 130 million subscribers, behind only Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon Prime, no small feat given that it just launched in November 2019.

The movie's first half is excessively dark -- both in terms of its actual dreary look and the story, as the young Han (Alden Ehrenreich) escapes an impoverished upbringing on his native Corellia and takes off to pursue his dreams of becoming a pilot.Harrison Ford left behind some sizable shoes, and Ehrenreich -- making a stratospheric leap after his breakthrough role in \"Hail, Caesar!\" -- initially struggles to fill them. But he gets better along with the movie, which features so many callbacks to earlier films that it's hard to imagine any \"Star Wars\" fan not feeling duty-bound to see it, even allowing for its shortcomings.Related: Ron Howard teases Han Solo film Those flourishes -- in a script from \"Star Wars\" scribe supreme Lawrence Kasdan and his son, Jonathan -- include, but aren't limited to, Han's first meetings with Chewbacca (7-footer Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian, who Donald Glover plays with a devilish gleam in his eye. Glover instantly enlivens the movie, managing to simultaneously pay homage to Billy Dee Williams' characterization while mildly spoofing it.Read MoreIn terms of new characters, the key figures are Qi'ra (\"Game of Thrones'\" Emilia Clarke), the girl in Han's life, and his motivation for much of what ensues; and Beckett (Woody Harrelson), a smuggler/thief whose anything-for-a-buck mentality will play a role in forging -- and defining the contours of -- Han's own moral code. (\"Westworld's\" Thandie Newton is part of Beckett's crew, adding to the HBO fantasy/sci-fi connection.)It's all a trifle uninspiring at first, before giving way to what amounts to an elaborate heist section, with a muscular, fast-paced action sequence. But the film really kicks into a higher gear -- literally as well as figuratively -- when Han finally meets one of the great loves in his life, the Millennium Falcon, his face lighting up the first time he settles in behind the controls.The technical wizardry augments these scenes, as do the musical cues incorporated by composer John Powell, weaving in snippets of John Williams' earlier themes -- most notably from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" -- in a way that helps recapture the spirit of the original trilogy, at least during certain key moments.With so much going on in the \"Star Wars\" universe since Disney acquired Lucasfilm, there's always a question of when new stand-alone projects will begin bumping into each other or run out of real estate. But perhaps the most encouraging thing one can say about \"Solo\" is that unlike \"Rogue One,\" it not only leaves room for a possible sequel to this prequel, but finishes strongly enough that such a prospect seems enticing.In hindsight, tackling such a beloved character -- 41 years to the day after \"Star Wars'\" introduction with \"A New Hope\" -- presented an especially daunting task, inviting sky-high expectations.

From the journalists interviewed to video of CNBC's Jim Cramer, that dynamic allowed Holmes not to create a new technology, but rather to wow investors merely by perpetuating the illusion of having done so.Holmes was indicted on federal wire-fraud charges in 2018, along with the company's former president, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani. They have both pleaded not guilty. (A movie, inevitably, is in the works, with Jennifer Lawrence to play Holmes.)Theranos has been described as a cautionary tale, as well as an indictment of a wider Silicon Valley culture that preaches to \"fake it till you make it.\" That seems especially true in the previously unseen video that Gibney has acquired of Holmes delivering speeches to rally the troops, promoting an us-against-the-world mentality that justified the company's obsessive secrecy and paranoia.For that reason and others, \"The Inventor\" is one of those documentaries that -- unlike The Edison -- really gets under your skin.\"The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley\" premieres March 18 at 9 p.m. on HBO."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "9", "day": "9"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "The reboot of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" has come home.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)The reboot of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" has come home.Will Smith announced Tuesday on his YouTube Channel that the new series has been signed by Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service.\"We have just officially closed the deal with Peacock with an unprecedented two-season order from a pitch,\" Smith said in the video, which shows him on a virtual call with others including writer/director Morgan Cooper, whose viral video inspired the new series. \"I've been in this business for 30 years, and that does not happen.\" Cooper's four-minute spec trailer reimagines the comedy starring Smith, which ran on NBC from 1990 to 1996, as a drama.

Peter Dinklage also walked away with his fourth supporting actor Emmy for \"Thrones.\"Still, all that glittered was not old, in a night that spread the wealth among networks and series, reflecting the breadth and depth of the current TV landscape.Voters also recognized first-time nominees like Jodie Comer for BBC America's \"Killing Eve,\" \"Ozark's\" Julia Garner and Jharrel Jerome for the limited series \"When They See Us.\"Emmy Awards 2019: Best red carpet fashion Jerome overcame a field filled with veterans and Oscar winners for the fact-based Netflix limited series \"When They See Us,\" writer-director Ava DuVernay's Netflix limited series about the Central Park Five, to whom he dedicated the prize, along with his parents.\"Chernobyl\" was named best limited series, with additional honors for writing and directing in a loaded category that included \"When They See Us\" and \"Fosse/Verdon,\" whose star, Michelle Williams, took lead actress.Accepting for \"Chernobyl,\" writer-producer Craig Mazin said he hoped the story about the nuclear-plant disaster in 1986 would remind people \"of the value of the truth, and the danger of a lie.\" It was one of several not-so-subtle political messages woven into the telecast, although President Donald Trump was never overtly mentioned.A relative newcomer, Jerome triumphed against a field of veteran actors and Oscar winners for \"When They See Us,\" writer-director Ava DuVernay's Netflix limited series about the Central Park Five, to whom he dedicated the prize, along with his parents.Williams, meanwhile, was one of several honorees to speak of female empowerment and hearing women, after winning for her portrayal of actress/dancer Gwen Verdon, in another example of Hollywood having a fondness for Hollywood stories.In her accepting speech, Patricia Arquette -- a supporting actress winner for Hulu's \"The Act\" -- teared up speaking about the death of her sister, actress and transgender activist Alexis Arquette, while making a plea for rights and acceptance of transgender people. Waller-Bridge's acting victory deprived Julia Louis-Dreyfus a chance to make Emmy history. A win would have made the \"Veep\" star the most-honored performer for acting, leaving her tied with Cloris Leachman, with eight in her career. (Louis-Dreyfus has three more awards for producing the show.)\"Fleabag\" also won the Emmy for directing, while Emmy voters again smiled on the period dramedy \"Mrs. Maisel,\" which mounted a near-sweep of those awards last year (with \"Veep,\" notably, sitting out the race). Alex Borstein claimed her second consecutive supporting actress win for the Amazon dramedy, while Tony Shalhoub received his fourth Emmy overall.Bill Hader was a repeat winner as lead actor for HBO's \"Barry,\" breaking up what was otherwise an Amazon block party.Repeat winners, in fact, dominated the early part of the show, with \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" running off with the prize for best competition program. Host RuPaul injected the first note of politics into the evening, urging viewers to go register and vote. Once the comedy categories ended, the show quickly conjured several emotional moments, including standing ovations for the casts of \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Veep,\" the two long-running HBO series that ended their runs in the spring.Netflix's interactive episode \"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\" was honored with best TV movie, topping a field that included HBO's \"Deadwood\" revival.HBO finished the two-part Emmy process with 34 Emmys -- including nine on Sunday night, or a third of those doled out -- followed by Netflix, with 27, Amazon -- the runner-up in terms of high-profile victories Sunday, with seven -- finished with 15, in a night that saw ads for new streaming players, Disney+ and Apple TV+, which will launch in November.In a sign of the times, NBC garnered a pair of awards for \"Saturday Night Live,\" the only broadcast program to earn an award on Sunday. All told, the four major broadcasters totaled 16 awards this year, mostly in technical areas, as eight networks or streaming services took at least one honor during Sunday's festivities.\"Chernobyl\" amassed 10 wins, while \"Mrs. Maisel\" and \"Fleabag\" finished the season with eight and six, respectively.HBO and Netflix entered Emmy night with 25 and 23 awards, respectively, from the Creative Arts Emmys, which were presented last weekend.Like this year's Oscars, the Emmys were presented without a host, but as usual was presented as a broad celebration of the medium. \"Television has never been this damn good,\" Bryan Cranston said, in the show's introduction.Fox televised the ceremony, and used the pre-show as a springboard to help promote the return of its musical reality show \"The Masked Singer.\" Traditionally, ratings dip when the awards play on Fox, coming off what was already record-low tune-in in 2018."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2022", "month": "1", "day": "9"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "After a two-and-a-half-year gap between seasons with a two-part special in between, \"Euphoria\" returns, offering the latest permutation of youthful angst.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)After a two-and-a-half-year gap between seasons with a two-part special in between, \"Euphoria\" returns, offering the latest permutation of youthful angst.Despite Zendaya's attention-getting, award-winning presence, the HBO series remains so unrelentingly bleak and nihilistic that it's overly defined by how far series creator Sam Levinson will push standards in terms of nudity, sex and drug use. (Answer: Pretty far indeed.)\"Euphoria\" works overtime to differentiate itself from the airbrushed soapiness of \"Gossip Girl\" or other TV contributions to the genre, endeavoring to rival the rawest movies that have probed these areas or premium series like \"Genera+ion\" and \"13 Reasons Why,\" itself a source of controversy.Yet any television show ultimately boils down to the characters, which is where the series falls short, even with the flights of fantasy -- giving certain episodes an almost dreamlike quality -- and heavy-handed narration provided by Zendaya's Rue, whose struggles with addiction persist.Levinson has structured the season as a series of stories involving individual characters, gradually bringing those strands together over the course of the seven episodes previewed. Yet there's a repetitive quality to the issues at work, central among them Rue's relationship with Jules (Hunter Schafer) and the triangle involving Cassie (Sydney Sweeney),  Maddy (Alexa Demie) and Nate (Jacob Elordi), each bruised and damaged in their own way.Read MoreNor does the new season completely escape the earlier tendency to reduce the parents to either monsters or ineffectual nags that recall the unseen voices in the old Charlie Brown cartoons, despite an effort to flesh out some of their histories.Criticizing \"Euphoria\" as someone weaned on earlier generations of teen dramas risks a certain \"Get off my lawn\" quality, and the show has its share of critical admirers and ardent fans, earning Zendaya an Emmy for its first season and the intensity of her performance.That said, as written the characters almost dare viewers to care too deeply about them, and the show's attempts to be edgy occasionally feel simply icky, including a later encounter in which a gun is brandished as a kind of foreplay.Granted, in the streaming age a show like this isn't intended to be everyone's cup of tea and doesn't need to be, with the advantage that \"Euphoria\" appeals to an audience that might not regularly watch much else on HBO or HBO Max. (It returns along with another series presenting a different spin on dysfunctional families, \"The Righteous Gemstones,\" which isn't a particularly compatible pairing.)The teens in \"Euphoria\" (played by twentysomethings, as is common) haven't cornered the market on self-absorption and obviously didn't invent it. In the final analysis, though, this latest batch of episodes unfolds with the kind of grim, unpleasant efficiency that can make one feel every bit as numb as Rue sounds.\"Euphoria\" season two premieres Jan 9 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.

The moment the series finished editing its final episode, Naeme adds, he began developing a film follow-up.\"The rumblings continued, and I gradually came to terms with the fact that there was a desire for a film and there was a market for it out there, and that I'd better start thinking about what we would put into it,\" says Fellows. Indeed, the audience's appetite proved to be quite voracious: in its opening weekend, \"Downtown Abbey\" defied projections by besting both the Sylvester Stallone-led action sequel \"Rambo: Last Blood\" and Brad Pitt's sci-fi opus \"Ad Astra\" with a surprise $31 million haul -- three times its production budget.Elizabeth McGovern stars as Lady Grantham, Harry Hadden-Paton as Lord Hexham, Laura Carmichael as Lady Hexham, Hugh Bonneville as Lord Grantham and Michael Fox as Andy in 'Downton Abbey'But the road to the box office bonanza wasn't cut and dried -- Fellowes, Naeme and production team had to approach the project with the same painstaking care they'd lavished on the series.After a review of the series, and the final episode in particular, to take stock of where things had gone and might yet go, \"I was conscious of looking for an event that would affect everyone in the house, and not just the family or just the servants,\" says Fellowes. \"But at the same time I wanted it to be a positive effect -- largely positive, anyway, I didn't mind if some people were angry, as long as they have some kind of reaction.\"Inspiration for an all-encompassing story hook came when Fellowes read a book about a real-life tour of the Yorkshire countryside that England's monarchs King George V and Queen Mary had made in 1912. \"As I read it, I thought, 'Well, this is my idea!'\" Fellowes reveals, transplanting the action to 1927. \"They'll come to Downton, and that will put everyone on their toes. Everyone will have to kind of take a line about the whole thing. And then I did a bit more research into royal visits and that's how I came to it.\"Naeme instantly saw the cinematic potential of the concept. \"It was just true to our core values,\" he says. \"It felt like it was absolutely a story that could've been in the TV show, but it was of a much bigger scale...That was the biggest thing that we could do, and therefore it was a bigger story than those that we'd covered in the TV series.\"The story easily lent itself to subplots for all of the \"Downtown\" regulars, which led to a new challenge. \"How do we get 20 actors who now are world famous, have these careers that are taking them all over the place, all available at the same time? And that was very complicated,\" admits Naeme.\"There were times when I thought this won't happen, but I was absolutely determined, because I felt it was a contract I had with the fans...And I would've felt that we let everyone down if we hadn't pulled it off.\"During what Naeme called an \"agonizing\" year and a half of negotiations to get the cast in place, Fellowes toiled away on the script, knowing that he had a different task ahead of him than when writing the series. \"We wanted a combination of fans being welcomed back into a home which they had always enjoyed visiting and seeing people again whom they had always liked, and the kind of warmth associated with that,\" he says. \"But at the same time we wanted a convincing movie at the end of it.\"Jim Carter in 'Downton Abbey.'(Jaap Buitendijk / Focus Features)\n\n\"We very determined from the beginning that the film would be viewable by people who had not watched the series and that there would be enough information within the film to tell all the stories, that they didn't have to know anything from watching the show\" Fellowes adds. \"We stuck to that, and we've had several people say they enjoyed it even though they never watched the show at all, which is very much music to my ears.\"Fellowes reveals that he embraced the fact that he was pushing himself into fresh storytelling territory. \"I rather enjoyed the change,\" he says. \"Writing a series is different from writing a film -- that's just a basic structural fact. In a series, not every character expects to get a proper plot every week...Whereas in a film, I felt that every character we used had to have a narrative reason for being there. And every story we told had to be resolved before we parted. So that in itself was a completely different discipline to the series.\"The film's director Michael Engler, who helmed several episodes of the series, recalls that when cast and crew finally reconvened to begin shooting the film, returning to now-iconic Highclere Castle and other familiar locales, there was a brief, tentative moment as everyone wondered whether they remembered how to figuratively ride a bicycle again.\"It took a second, really -- literally like a couple of minutes,\" says Engler. \"Everybody had gone on and done other things and been busy. Some people have seen each other, some people haven't. What was surreal about it was it felt almost like Rip Van Winkle: you go to sleep, and three years later, you wake up and just pick up where you left off.\"When crafting the film's visual language, Engler had the unenviable task of hewing closely to the established style of the series while simultaneously venturing into more cinematic territory. \"We didn't want to change the fundamental DNA of it, but we wanted to grow it and to expand it,\" he says. \"Because we had more time, more money, more resources, we could give ourselves more extravagant opportunities, like helicopter shots and drone shooting....[We could] just allow ourselves to be a little less reserved, a little bolder in some ways...The goal was to make it feel like the same, but elevated and richer in the design.\"Michelle Dockery in 'Downton Abbey'Along with the familiar \"Downton\" approach to lovingly chronicling the methodically, almost ritualistically performed chores throughout the estate, Engler was able to apply a similar but grander approach to the pomp and circumstance accompanying the royals and their entourage. \"One of the things that I've always loved about 'Downton' was it takes that stuff very seriously,\" says the filmmaker. \"It doesn't play fast and loose, and just say, 'Oh, it doesn't really matter where anybody stands, as long as it looks good.' Everything is done exactly the way it would have been done.\"\"Another fun thing about it is that when everybody's behavior is expected to be at its most correct and proper,\" Engler says. \"Then the little variations that come out of just human nature -- excitement, nervousness, pride, any number of things, then showing those little areas where it slightly shifts or goes off is kind of fun.\"Fellowes says watching those time-honored processes has a calming effect.\"There is something fascinating and emotionally pleasant about watching everything go into its correct place,\" he offers, noting that it also steeps the Crawleys in tradition. \"Every family has its own rituals of how they celebrate Christmas, and they don't vary from year to year because their familiarity is part of the pleasure, and I think that that is part of the pleasure of 'Downton,' really.\"Ultimately, all the factors would successfully converge to make for a creatively -- and eventually, commercially -- successful transition to the big screen. \"From the moment you see the first reveal of Downtown Abbey at the beginning of the movie, with John Lunn's extraordinary beautiful music, you really know you're back, bigger and better than ever before,\" says Naeme. Even before the box office numbers came in, Naeme was already envisioning an ongoing film franchise. \"I see absolutely no reason why we couldn't return,\" he says. An image of the 'Downton Abbey' cast in Season 5 of the television seriesOn the morning of the film's US release, Fellowes was a bit more cautious about extending his magnum opus. \"I've given up saying never in my life because I knew as soon as I say it that I have to retract it,\" he says. He's in the midst of casting and finding locations for his next project, \"The Gilded Age,\" a series set in 1880s New York City for HBO, as well adapting his 2016 historical novel Belgravia into a six-part series for ITV and Epix (both projects are also produced by Naeme), so he already has a pretty full plate. \"I can see a situation in which there might be another movie, but let's have at least a few days to consider how well this one has been received.\"Nine years after the series debuted on the BBC, Fellowes contends that he's not entirely sure why \"Downton Abbey\" continues to strike such a nerve among its faithful. \"Lots of people have written lots of words about why, but then nobody seems really to fully to understand or explain it,\" he says. \"It's been tremendous fun to be at the heart of it, to be at the center of it -- you can be sure of that. But as to quite why it's has been a worldwide phenomenon and the way it has...I really don't understand it.\"\"Obviously on some level or other we got the mix right, but quite why and what ingredients were so right, I couldn't tell you,\" Fellowes adds. \"I think we have a wonderful cast, and there's something in its combination of comfort and drama that seems to appeal, and humor that other shows that have had very similar recipes have not have done so well. I don't know. I just thank God for it, really.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2014", "month": "1", "day": "18"}, "text": {"headline": "us", "text": "View Fast Facts from CNN about the life Meryl Streep, 21-time Academy Award nominated actress and three time winner.

The result is a warm if somewhat flat trip back in time that approximates the feel of the show's Christmas specials, only over-sized, and as cozy as a seat by the manor's fire.After six seasons that yielded the kind of ratings PBS seldom sees, \"Downton\" closed its run in 2016, with happy endings all around. So series creator Julian Fellowes had some work to do in order to devise the circumstances that would justify a return engagement, settling on a Royal visit, with all the pomp and circumstance that entails.From the first distant glimpse of the estate, as John Lunn's lush score swells in accompaniment, it's clear that the movie will basically luxuriate in the show's elegant trappings, with everything slightly magnified from its TV incarnation.At the same time, there are chaotic preparations to receive the king and queen, and comical friction with the Royal Family's retinue, who bring several trunks of snotty attitude along with them. That dynamic actually conjures more drama in the downstairs part of the house, where the retired butler Carson (Jim Carter) is brought out of retirement like an old relief pitcher, much to the chagrin of his replacement, Mr. Barrow (Robert James-Collier).Read MoreUpstairs, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) finds herself wrestling, again, with whether the way of life into which she was born -- where a privileged family resides in a great house teeming with servants -- is disappearing; brother-in-law Tom (Allen Leech) is questioned about his allegiance to the monarchy; and the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) clashes, as only she can, with a relative (Imelda Staunton, one of the newcomers) with royal connections, who can more than hold her own.Jim Carter in 'Downton Abbey.'(Jaap Buitendijk / Focus Features)\n\nWorking with director Michael Engler, Fellowes as usual finds meaty material for an abundance of characters, which has always been his gift. In Barrow's case, that includes a somewhat deeper dive into what it meant to be gay and closeted in this era. It's nevertheless difficult to completely surmount questions -- other than the cash grab -- of elevating this to a movie, even if the sense of finery is understandably heightened by the family's guests, yielding the sort of dazzling imagery will likely renew tourism interest in Highclere Castle.Nevertheless, it's worth a return to Downton if only for the greatness of these characters and their particular quirks, from hearing Carter's puffed-up Carson mention acts of \"disloyal tomfoolery\" to Smith's imperious Dowager saying, well, pretty much anything, especially when sparring with Isobel (Penelope Wilton).It's easy to argue that this trip back was unnecessary, a description that applies to many a revival and reboot. That's especially true, perhaps, because the show closed the book in such tidy fashion.Despite the series' much-adorned run, the movie isn't a masterpiece, or the sort of event that might warrant rushing out to the theater. Ultimately, though, it's another satisfying chapter, demonstrating that enough still glitters around \"Downton Abbey\" to make it worth seeing for anyone who loved the show, eventually, if not sooner.\"Downton Abbey\" premieres Sept. 20 in the US.

Watchable but inconsistent, the half-hour series dilutes its genuine pathos and strengths with characters and situations that seem to have parachuted in from a different show.Gilchrist turned out to be the best thing about Showtime's \"United States of Tara,\" and he impressively follows up on that with his performance as 18-year-old Sam, who is awkwardly seeking to navigate the bridge from childhood to adulthood. Sam narrates what transpires while doling out bits of encyclopedic knowledge about things like the mating habits of penguins.Like any number of shows about a family with a special member -- \"Tara\" being a prime example -- everything in \"Atypical\" flows from how the rest of the brood deals with the challenges that Sam brings into their lives.\" allowfullscreen>For mom Elsa (Leigh), that includes striking up a flirtation with a bartender (Raul Castillo) -- causing her to wince when someone mentions the need for \"self-care\" at her support group -- while carrying a lingering grudge against her husband (Michael Rapaport), who had trouble dealing with Sam in the past.Sam's sister Casey (Brigette Lundy-Paine), meanwhile, is a star athlete, but her accomplishments are frequently overlooked in the chaos that surrounds their home.Read MoreThe series, however, which hails from producers of ABC's \"The Goldbergs,\" too often falls back on clich\u00e9s.

They follow the BBC's \"The A Word\" and HBO's award-winning movie \"Temple Grandin.\"The serialized storytelling pulls viewers along through the eight episodes, but if there's a primary reason to watch, it's Gilchrist. Almost single-handedly elevating the show when he's on screen, the actor brings not just vulnerability to the role but also manages to make Sam's various tics, inappropriate utterances and literal interpretations feel wholly organic and painfully real.Beyond that, faced with the high expectations of a crowded premium-TV market, \"Atypical\" does something that its protagonist can't -- namely, blend in.\"Atypical\" premieres Aug. 11 on Netflix."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "7", "day": "22"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "For Netflix, its latest one-two punch of docuseries might be called \"love and death\" -- \"Love on the Spectrum,\" a sweet Australian import about people with autism seeking romance; and \"Fear City: New York vs. the Mafia,\" an overwrought trip back to the mob era of the 1970s and '80s that isn't nearly as good as it should be.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)For Netflix, its latest one-two punch of docuseries might be called \"love and death\" -- \"Love on the Spectrum,\" a sweet Australian import about people with autism seeking romance; and \"Fear City: New York vs. the Mafia,\" an overwrought trip back to the mob era of the 1970s and '80s that isn't nearly as good as it should be.\"Fear City\" would appear to be the more marketable of the two, recounting the mob's brazen behavior before the feds figured out how to dismantle the organization, whose \"code of silence\" and pyramid-like structure made prosecutions difficult. But the producers labor to build drama around a story that's plenty dramatic without all the embroidery.What former mobster Michael Franzese calls \"The golden era of the mob\" had the unfortunate side effect of leaving bodies and bloodshed all over the city, heightening pressure for a federal response.Mob boss Paul Castellano in 'Fear City: New York vs. The Mafia.' As FBI veteran Jim Kossler recalls, the authorities had \"no strategy, no plan\" for dealing with the \"five families,\" until Cornell professor Robert Blakey conceived of using RICO law (that is, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization) to connect foot soldiers to the bosses -- who had been insulated from prosecution -- and bring the whole enterprise tumbling down.The centerpiece of the three-part project resides in access to audiotapes from FBI wiretaps, making the viewer privy to colorful conversations peppered with salty language that sound like outtakes from \"The Sopranos.\"Read MoreThose weaned on mob yarns of the period -- from \"The Godfather\" saga to Martin Scorsese's films -- will surely find echoes from those movies. Yet \"Fear City\" doesn't so much expand on that window as simply cannibalize it.The documentary concludes with the corruption that surrounded the construction industry, before moving to the courtroom, mixing interviews with mob figures and those responsible for their prosecution. The latter roster includes Michael Chertoff (who went on to head the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security) and former New York city mayor Rudy Giuliani, who parlayed the high-profile cases into his political rise.The main drawback involves the heavy-handed way much of this is presented, such as employing tight closeups on the faces of prosecutors and feds during the trial coverage, as if they're waiting for these decades-old verdicts right now.For those enamored with tales of the mob, \"Fear City\" weaves in enough previously unheard audio to marginally justify the three-hour binge. Beyond that, even from someone fascinated by the subject matter, it's tough to deliver a favorable judgment.\" allowfullscreen>\"Love on the Spectrum,\" by contrast, serves as an understated antidote to most of Netflix's dating fare, which has tended to be of the loud and gimmicky variety, including \"Love is Blind\" and \"Too Hot to Handle.\"Like the recently introduced \"Indian Matchmaking,\" it provides a window into the hunt for love and connection, with the key here being the added degree of difficulty and vulnerability that some on the autism spectrum experience.The filmmakers follow along on dates, join their subjects as they meet with a counselor regarding do's and don'ts of romance, and venture into their homes, capturing parents whose enthusiasm goes hand in hand with concern.There are, not surprisingly, some uncomfortable moments, including a few times when the participants feel overwhelmed and essentially ask for a break from filming. (The director is occasionally heard off camera, checking how they are and offering reassurance.)Unlike their posturing counterparts on most dating shows, the realness of these people provides a winning edge. And when 25-year-old Michael -- obsessed with old TV shows -- takes a date to a convention and gets to meet Dawn Wells of \"Gilligan's Island,\" you'd have to be pretty heartless to resist.More than anything, \"Love on the Spectrum\" exhibits empathy toward the featured players without condescending toward them, and quickly bridges any cultural barriers in a broadly universal manner.

Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez play the unlikely sleuths, in a Hulu series that's good fun as long as you don't over-think it.Martin's Charles is a former TV star -- his history with a crime procedural comes in handy -- who has essentially become a recluse. He grudgingly catches up with Short's Oliver, a cash-strapped theater director, when the two are forced to evacuate their building because one of the residents has been murdered.Before long, they've teamed with a mysterious and much younger neighbor, Mabel (Gomez), hatching elaborate plans to not only crack the case but to turn their findings into a true-crime podcast.Co-created by Martin and John Hoffman, who also produced along with a team that includes \"This is Us'\" Dan Fogelman, the series not surprisingly revels in inside-showbiz humor, drawing on Charles and Oliver's self-obsessed backgrounds. But it also reveals an astute ear for true crime, exploiting the notion that Manhattanites go about their business without knowing much about who's down the hall, much less in the rest of the building.The big names don't end with the central trio, attracting cameos by the likes of Tina Fey, Nathan Lane and Amy Ryan, as well as a certain rock star who happens to be one of the building's understandably wary occupants. Read MoreAs with movies like Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" (one of the more obvious comparisons, though there are plenty), the notion that it takes a life-and-death situation to get the blood pumping is clearly evident here.

In a nice dichotomy, it's a throwback to an earlier kind of entertainment, but all about podcasts and running on a new-fangled streaming service.

The show returns for a shortened final season minus one of them, Alan Arkin, but provides a sweet, sentimental signoff for Michael Douglas in the title role.Both Douglas and Arkin earned awards nominations for the show (Douglas won a Golden Globe, a statuette that isn't quite as glittery these days), which cast the former as imperious acting coach Sandy Kominsky, and the latter as his longtime agent and friend, Norman Newlander.Norman's exit is logically explained, and his shadow hangs over the third season, which sees Sandy tackling fresh challenges and responsibilities, while significantly reconnecting with his ex-wife Roz (Kathleen Turner), in what amounts to an extended \"Romancing the Stone\" reunion.Sandy also frets about the future of his daughter, Mindy (Sarah Baker), who is heading toward the altar with her much-older boyfriend Martin (Paul Reiser), a situation that Roz embraces more philosophically than her ex. As for the colorful characters at the acting class, success for one of Sandy's students brings him into contact with Morgan Freeman, playing -- in the best \"Entourage\"-like Hollywood tradition -- an appropriately jaundiced version of himself, in a savvy spoof of TV dramas.Produced by sitcom maestro Chuck Lorre (\"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Young Sheldon\" and more), \"Kominsky Method\" clearly relishes its latitude in terms of risqu\u00e9 language, sexual situations and showbiz jokes aimed at people who have dined at Hollywood hangout Musso and Frank's.Read MoreThe show's real provocation, however, has been its laser focus on the indignities of aging, a genuine indulgence in an industry notorious for how harshly it treats its elders.Driven by subscriptions, not advertising, Netflix has shrewdly taken advantage of that -- \"Grace and Frankie\" being another season with senior-citizen stars -- and the jokes about little blue pills share space with lots of casual slights, in a town where the experience that comes from aging is unvalued.Without giving anything away, Lorre and don't necessarily ride the jaded mentality that has informed the series all the way to the end. The result is a six-episode season that deals with friendship, grief and loss in ways that are alternately funny and touching and, overall, satisfying, yielding another strong showcase for Douglas.Whether that translates into further accolades remains to be seen -- particularly in this condensed six-episode format -- but for those who invested in the previous seasons, \"The Kominsky Method\" gets the curtain call that it deserved.\"The Kominsky Method's\" third season premieres May 28 on Netflix."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "6", "day": "17"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Like everything else she's done, Rita Moreno is an exceptional storyteller, turning \"Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It\" -- an \"American Masters\" documentary hitting theaters first -- into a dazzling look at the much-adorned star's career, and the doors left shut, despite her success, by being a Latina in Hollywood during the days of the studio system.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)Like everything else she's done, Rita Moreno is an exceptional storyteller, turning \"Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It\" -- an \"American Masters\" documentary hitting theaters first -- into a dazzling look at the much-adorned star's career, and the doors left shut, despite her success, by being a Latina in Hollywood during the days of the studio system.Moreno is in the select group EGOT winners -- people who have earned an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

Mayer at age 16, impressing him enough to land a studio contract.

The paucity of worthwhile parts forced her to keep reinventing herself, from her Tony-winning stage role in \"The Ritz\" to TV work ranging from children's series \"The Electric Company,\" whose album earned her a Grammy, to the grim prison drama \"Oz.\"Off screen, Moreno engaged in activism that included the civil-rights movement and endured a lengthy and toxic romance with Marlon Brando.

Those conversations consider the battles still being fought -- underscored by the \"In the Heights\" colorism debate -- as well as the extent to which subsequent generations owe a debt to Moreno's struggles and triumphs.The net effect is a tribute to all that Moreno achieved over the course of a 70-year career, tempered by an equally bittersweet asterisk: How high would this \"girl\" have flown, given her talents, without facing those formidable headwinds?\"Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It\" premieres in theaters on June 18."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "12", "day": "3"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "The new \"West Side Story\" doesn't entirely answer the most obvious question, which is why essentially remake a 60-year-old classic.

The casting and subtle touches, like not subtitling the Spanish dialogue, also possess considerably more cultural authenticity than a period where non-Latinx actors would be cast in pivotal roles.As an added bonus, the filmmakers have not only included Rita Moreno -- an Oscar winner for the 1961 movie -- as the drug-store owner, but cleverly expanded that role in a way that showcases her. If the intention was to provide a reminder that the 89-year-old Moreno, a winner of every award imaginable, is a national treasure, mission accomplished.Beyond that, the bones of \"West Side Story,\" itself inspired by Romeo and Juliet, remain very much intact, with the mix of jaunty tunes and lushly romantic ballads courtesy of Sondheim and composer Leonard Bernstein, in its tragic tale of love at first sight.Ansel Elgort and newcomer Rachel Zegler play the star-crossed Tony and Maria, whose instant infatuation comes in the midst of racial strife between two gangs: the Sharks, headed by her brother Bernardo (David Alvarez), and the Jets, run by Tony's longtime pal Riff (Mike Faist), who's mystified by Tony's desire to leave that brutal life behind.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDLegendary composer Steven Sondheim has diedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegendary composer Steven Sondheim has died 03:36While the dance numbers are muscularly choreographed, Spielberg has tamped down some of the magic associated with director Robert Wise's version, a decision evident when Tony and Maria first meet at the dance. Back then, the world stopped around them; here, they discreetly retreat to a quiet spot behind the gym bleachers.It's no slight to the male cast members to say the women outshine them. Zegler (who'll follow this debut with another iconic role as Snow White) is positively luminous as Maria, and Ariana DeBose ably fills Moreno's shoes as Anita, who possesses faith in pursuing an American dream that Bernardo and his rivals have given up hope of achieving.Of course, \"West Side Story\" has hardly been dormant in the intervening decades, with stage revivals and more high-school productions than anyone could count. Yet Spielberg and Kushner have toed a delicate line in crafting a movie that exhibits fidelity to the original while tinkering with it in ways that invite comparisons to the variations -- some completely logical, others a bit more arbitrary.The film marks the first time Spielberg has tackled a musical in his storied and eclectic career, which makes the effort an occasion on that level. That he has done so in a year populated by several others, including \"In the Heights\" and \"Tick, Tick ... Boom!,\" reflects how cycles shift and the appetite for content has grown.Ultimately, \"West Side Story\" passes the \"why\" test and will likely leave fans debating which version they prefer. Even those of the opinion there wasn't a burning need for a redo -- reimagined or otherwise -- should conclude there's a place for this one too.\"West Side Story\" premieres in US theaters on Dec. 10.

It was a persona Trump had cultivated throughout his adult life, but one uniquely seared into the public consciousness through exposure to millions each week on NBC. (Jeff Zucker, who oversees CNN as WarnerMedia Chairman of News and Sports, was President of NBC Entertainment when the show premiered.)Read MoreAs a viewer, the artifice that went into producing reality TV always bothered me. On \"The Apprentice,\" for example, I remember Trump asking to get Joan Rivers on the phone, followed by a cut to Rivers answering and chatting with him.How convenient that the comic somehow had a camera crew with her at the very moment when Trump decided to call.Such criticisms, though, were generally dismissed, and critics who bothered to question those practices could easily be branded as scolds and worrywarts. Everyone knew this was just entertainment, the refrain went, and as the boilerplate disclaimers stated, the editing didn't affect the outcome.Still, the assumption that the public was wise to the tricks of the trade always sounded unduly optimistic. That point has been driven home over the years by media coverage of \"reality TV\" (just putting it in quotes was another imperfect solution), chronicling the latest developments on major hits like breaking news when a closer analogy would be plot twists on a scripted soap opera.Richard Hatch and Susan Hawk during the first season of 'Survivor' in 2000. (Photo by CBS via Getty Images) Indeed, when the Los Angeles Times initially proposed calling reality shows unscripted, a producer who worked on them took exception to that designation as well.\"I write nonfiction television programs,\" Joan Owens-Meyerson, also a member of the Writers Guild, wrote in response. \"I also produce and direct them, and I know that any good film -- nonfiction or otherwise -- begins with the story. We nonfiction TV writers script our stories using real people and situations; our job is to create a compelling story out of that reality without compromising the truth.\"The TV industry, notably, has taken some steps to acknowledge variations under the \"reality\" umbrella, including changes in 2014 to the way they are identified for Emmy Award consideration. The categories range from \"reality competition\" to \"structured\" and \"unstructured\" reality, indicating whether series adhere to a specific formula or merely follow people with a camera, although even those distinctions entail shades of gray.In the early days of \"reality TV,\" there were also a number of scandals, where producers were caught staging or manipulating situations in a questionable way.In one case, a former producer on a competition show titled \"Manhunt\" said the program, which was shot in Hawaii, wrote and filmed scenes in Los Angeles' Griffith Park, then added them later. Questions arose about the background of the bachelor in Fox's \"Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?\" and whether, among other things, he was as wealthy as advertised. (At the time, the network said his net worth totaled $2 million, which would be the bare minimum to meet that designation.)So it went, but people grew accustomed to the genre, and nothing seemed to shake its appeal. In September, Fox's \"The Masked Singer\" returned, creating the appearance of a studio audience by digitally inserting crowd shots -- a case of unreality if there ever was one.A Fox spokeswoman noted that the network acknowledged the practice in advance interviews, and included an on-air disclaimer saying that \"Due to health restrictions, visuals of audience featured in this episode included virtual shots as well as shots from past seasons.\" Even so, many viewers expressed confusion on social media about whether the show had ignored Covid-19 protocols.Is that a problem? Broadly speaking, perhaps not. Yet whatever the facts are about Donald Trump's history as a businessman, it seems undeniable that many people knew him as the Donald Trump they saw on \"The Apprentice.\"Trump has always been a showman, even before becoming a TV star or politician, and as the latest flurry of events illustrated, his presidency has exhibited an acute consciousness of how things look on TV. Yet to the extent \"reality TV\" has blurred the line between perception and reality, Burnett and the modern version of the genre he helped pioneer served, in a sense, as the president's too-rarely-credited running mates."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "5", "day": "26"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Originally intended to help launch HBO Max, \"Friends: The Reunion\" finally hits the streaming service, in big, slightly bloated, unapologetically nostalgic form.

A valentine to fans, the nearly two-hour special is inevitably hard-pressed to justify the hype, working best when it lets the cast casually reminisce, while getting carried away with cameos, some of which, well, couldn't be more random.\"Friends\" signed off in 2004, and part of the special's appeal is simply seeing the band back together again, looking older (to varying degrees) and undeniably a whole lot richer. One by one, they return to the set and soundstage, exchanging slightly awkward hugs (welcome to the Covid era) and sharing memories.Directed and produced by \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" producer Ben Winston, who recently did a fine job overseeing the Grammys, the special uses a mishmash of techniques to orchestrate and structure this walk down memory lane, including an in-person interview with Corden in front of an appreciative, socially distanced audience.Some of those touches play better than others, with perhaps the best being snippets in which the stars -- Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer -- engage in table reads of old episodes, intercut with snippets of the originals. It's the closest to a scripted \"Friends\" reunion we're apt to get, and fascinating to watch how seamlessly they appear to slide back into these roles, 17 years later.Other highlights include a taped piece in which producers Kevin Bright, Marta Kauffman and David Crane discuss casting the series -- and all the serendipity that went into bringing these six actors together -- and interviews with fans around the world, discussing what the show meant to them.Read MoreThe cast assembles in a familiar spot for 'Friends: The Reunion' (Terence Patrick).\"We didn't want stars,\" Crane recalls during the discussion about the casting process. Instead, \"Friends\" made its players into stars, leaving them in a very different place when they signed off a decade after it began.At the same time, \"The Reunion\" labors in places to conjure a sense of fun, putting the actors through game-show-style trivia tests and enlisting celebrities whose involvement alternately feels arbitrary and unnecessary.There are also notable oversights, such as the cast's all-for-one, one-for-all approach when negotiating their contracts in the later seasons -- a novel tactic, reflecting the program's true ensemble nature, the actors' solidarity, and the financial juggernaut that \"Friends\" became for NBC and production company Warner Bros. (which, like CNN and HBO Max, is a unit of WarnerMedia).Then again, \"Friends: The Reunion\" reflects the present media age as much as the mid-1990s period that birthed the show, when a network sitcom hit of this magnitude was still possible. Given the hunger for content and recognizable titles, what might have been a Museum of Television and Radio retrospective has essentially been blown up into highly promotable ammunition for the streaming wars.Taped in April, the special covers considerable ground that could inspire various \"Friends\"-esque episode titles, but when all's said and done, a few contenders pretty well apply: \"The One That Celebrates the Show,\" \"The One That Promotes a Streaming Service,\" \"The One That Tries A Little Too Hard,\" and at its best, \"The One That Gives Fans A Lot of What They Wanted.\"\"Friends: The Reunion\" premieres May 27 on HBO Max."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "2", "day": "12"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "If we were to select 10 movies that show off the veteran actor's versatility, we'd start with this list.

From Shakespeare to comedies, animated adventures and blockbuster franchises, Tucci is a shape-shifting master of all. His breadth of acting work is one the many reasons he's become an enduring fan favorite, capable of dominating social feeds with just the pour of a cocktail. Tucci has crafted a career that everyone can enjoy, developing an audience as wide-ranging as the characters he's played. With so many titles, it's hard to play favorites. But if we were to select ten roles that show off Tucci's versatility, we'd start with the list below. And if you find yourself craving something nonfiction, Tucci's still here to serve: He's hosting CNN's new Original Series, \"Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy,\" on Sunday nights at 9 p.m. ET. \"Big Night\" (1996) Read MoreThis Sundance hit was a big screen breakthrough for Tucci, who co-directed and co-wrote the film. Set in the 1950s, \"Big Night\" tells the story of two brothers who dream of success with a restaurant that celebrates authentic Italian cuisine. But the siblings --Tony Shalhoub as Primo and Tucci as Secondo -- are way ahead of their time; Americans in the '50s thought Italian food could be summed up with a plate of spaghetti and meatballs. To save their floundering restaurant, the brothers decide to go all out with an extraordinary \"big night\" extravaganza. The film is \"one of the great food movies,\" Roger Ebert wrote in his review, \"and yet it is so much more.\" Where to watch: Amazon Prime Video \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1999) Remember the Shakespearean phase of the 1990s? There was \"Shakespeare In Love\"; \"Romeo + Juliet\"; \"10 Things I Hate About You\"; and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" which featured Tucci as the prankster fairy Puck.  Accompanied by an all-star cast -- including Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Sam Rockwell and Calista Flockhart -- this classic turn further showcased Tucci's comedy chops. Where to watch: Purchase on demand \"Shall We Dance?\" (2004) Critics were lukewarm about this movie in general, but there was love for Tucci as a supporting player. The story isn't centered around his character, a lawyer named Link with a passion for ballroom dance, but he nonetheless delivered a performance the New York Times called \"funniest of all.\" Where to watch: HBO Max\"The Devil Wears Prada\" (2006) With Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Tucci all starring in this dramedy about the cutthroat inner workings of a fashion magazine, it's no surprise we're still quoting from it to this day.\"It's a f*****g brilliant movie,\" Tucci told Variety of this film's cultural endurance. \"The brilliant movies become influential, no matter what they are about.\"Where to watch: Purchase on demand \"Julie & Julia\" (2009) In this adaptation, written and directed by the late, legendary Nora Ephron, Tucci stars as Paul Child, the husband of culinary icon Julia Child. With a story that balances the couple's life in 1949 France with that of a present-day New York woman inspired to create Child's recipes, the movie \"glides ... like hot butter in a skillet,\" The Boston Globe said in its review. \"Much of the pleasure we have in watching [the film] comes from seeing Tucci and Streep connect.\"Where to watch: Netflix\"The Lovely Bones\" (2009) By the time this adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel emerged, Tucci was well-known for his comedic and dramatic skills. But playing a 1970s serial killer who preys on teen girls? It was a \"jolting\" casting choice, Entertainment Weekly said in its review, adding that the actor's portrayal of a neighbor with a violent dark side was \"honestly unsettling ... electrifying danger accompanies his every scene.\" The role earned Tucci an Oscar nod for best supporting actor. Where to watch: Hulu\"Easy A\" (2010) Tucci became the cool dad everyone wishes they had with this teen drama spin on Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter.\" As Dill Penderghast, Tucci played the easygoing parent of Emma Stone's Olive, a high school student who turns a salacious rumor into an opportunity. Whether it was his comedic timing, his pitch-perfect repartee with Stone and co-star Patricia Clarkson, or simply the fit of his T-shirts, this role added to Tucci's reputation as one of the Internet's favorite dads.  Where to watch: Netflix \"The Hunger Games\" (2012) And now we arrive to what may be one of Tucci's most memorable roles: That of Caesar Flickerman, the powdered and primped talk show host in the blockbuster dystopian franchise \"The Hunger Games.\" Tucci imbued his character with both wit and sensitivity through all four installments, resulting in a part as adored by the franchise's fanbase as its leading star Jennifer Lawrence. Almost 20 years after the success of \"Big Night,\" Tucci won over a new generation of fans. Where to watch: Hulu\"Spotlight\" (2015) In between \"Hunger Games\" installments, Tucci turned to a challenging project rooted in reality. This Oscar-winning film is based on the true story of a team of investigative journalists at the Boston Globe who unearthed a pattern of sexual abuse by Catholic Church priests. Tucci portrays an attorney representing the victims, part of a cast that delivers an experience \"both damning and inspiring, depressing and heartening,\" the Los Angeles Times said in its review. Where to watch: Netflix\"Supernova\" (2021) Tucci has shown himself to be an integral part of any ensemble cast several times over, but his latest project is a reminder that he can also take the lead. Alongside his friend of 20 years, Colin Firth, Tucci brings to life the story of a novelist with early-onset dementia who takes a road trip with his partner as his condition takes a turn for the worse.

The Carter campaign against incumbent President Gerald Ford ushered in a new post-Watergate approach in political coverage in TV news. Reports became more forceful and more openly questioned political authority. Read MoreAnd the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran, which wasn't resolved until the day Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency in 1981, gave TV viewers not only a hard look at the long-term ramifications of American foreign policy, but also gave birth to ABC's \"Nightline\" and provided a major justification for the launch of CNN as a 24-hour news operation in 1980.But so did the rise, early in the '70s of entertainment television that embraced and even sought out controversy rather than avoided it. The same CBS executives who fired variety show hosts the Smothers brothers from their self-titled show at the end of the '60s -- basically for insubordination, and for taking on issues like the Vietnam war -- turned around, at the start of the '70s, and gave us, in quick succession, the overt feminism of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" the taboo-busting \"All in the Family,\" and the anti-war comedy \"M*A*S*H.\" But it wasn't just about executives deciding to court a new generation of viewers. It was the viewers themselves, who signified -- by showing up in giant viewing blocks -- that they not only accepted entertainment content that meant something, they were hungry for it: The feminist heroine of \"Maude\" getting an abortion.

The miniseries \"Roots,\" which delved into all of black history by tracing the family tree of author Alex Haley. Talk shows became more significant in the '70s, in part because of the insistence of their hosts to follow their own interests. Johnny Carson, while ruling late night for decades, used his clout in the '70s to make stars of the likes of \"Cosmos\" host Carl Sagan, while talk host Dick Cavett, on PBS and elsewhere, interviewed Watergate investigators and co-conspirators, key artistic figures of the '70s (John Lennon, Gore Vidal, Jimi Hendrix), and just about anyone else who made a major cultural impact.JUST WATCHEDWomen in TV: From entry-level jobs to power playersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWomen in TV: From entry-level jobs to power players 02:58It was also a decade in which another programming genre, the TV variety show, reached its zenith, with the genial humor of \"The Carol Burnett Show\" and \"The Dean Martin Show,\" and the short-lived but daringly different anthology approach of \"The Great American Dream Machine.\" (When The Captain and Tennille and Starland Vocal Band could get their own variety shows, it was time to pull the plug on this genre.)And of course, it was a decade in which sketch comedy hit a new golden era, with everything from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" and \"Saturday Night Live\" to \"Second City TV\" and \"The Muppet Show.\" These shows led, directly if not indirectly, to just about every bold sketch series on TV since and even now, from Dave Chappelle and \"In Living Color\" to Amy Schumer and \"Louie.\" It indeed was a time, as the Pythons often said in their charmingly nonsensical transitions, \"for something completely different.\"But back to that sitcom form: This was what made the biggest and most important transformation of all in the '70s.The \"Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" showcasing its central character, Mary Richards, as a single \"career woman\" in Minneapolis, was far more \"liberal\" than such TV precursors as Eve Arden's \"Our Miss Brooks\" in the 1950s or Marlo Thomas' \"That Girl\" in the 1960s, where career focus always took a back seat to finding, luring or keeping a man.Simply by having its central character focus on her job, the show gave the women's liberation movement a weekly boost -- while the independent TV production company it launched, MTM Productions, developed a seminal stretch of superb comedies and dramas, including \"The Bob Newhart Show\" and \"St. Elsewhere,\" that essentially initiated the modern age of quality television.

By intentionally probing and showcasing sensitive topics and hot-button issues, from racism to abortion, \"All in the Family\" and its many spinoffs, including \"Maude,\" \"Good Times\" and \"The Jeffersons,\" confronted viewers with the type of controversies, and language, that had been considered taboo in a prime-time that had earlier favored witches, genies and flying nuns.Even sitcoms not produced by Lear, but focusing intentionally on race or place, owed a debt to him, from \"Chico and the Man\" to \"Sanford & Son\" and the multi-ethnic classroom of \"Welcome Back, Kotter,\" the unlikely launching pad for John Travolta. \"M*A*S*H,\" a TV spinoff of the bold Robert Altman comedy movie, did something unprecedented for a TV sitcom. It positioned itself as an anti-war comedy at a time when the United States itself was mired in an increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam. \"M*A*S*H\" was set in the '50s, during the Korean War, but as an allegory pushing for peace and serving as a constant reminder of the human cost of war, it reigned for more than a decade as one of TV's most popular comedies.JUST WATCHEDName that 70's TV show!

The miniseries truly exploded in the '70s, first with the PBS import of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\" (a precursor of \"Downton Abbey\"), then with ABC's \"Rich Man, Poor Man\" and the groundbreaking, record-shattering \"Roots\" in 1977, the finale of which drew an astounding 51%of all U.S. TV households. That translates to 100 million viewers for the finale alone, placing it, still, among the most popular entertainment programs ever televised.In \"Roots,\" author Alex Haley traced his family tree back -- from an African youth abducted and sold into slavery in the United States, to a southern plantation owner. It became the most popular scripted TV program shown to that point, and opened a dialogue, about race and racism that is far from over. It also led, quite quickly, in the early '80s, to the multiculturalism of the squad room in \"Hill Street Blues,\" the hospital in \"St. Elsewhere,\" and, most notably, to the all-black, hugely popular Huxtable family of \"The Cosby Show.\" The made-for-TV movie would also rise up in the '70s; among many other noteworthy efforts, it gave us 1971's \"Duel,\" the TV movie that would launch the film career of a young filmmaker named Steven Spielberg. It was \"Jaws\" on land, and a perfect audition for the movie Spielberg would craft four years later-- inventing the summer blockbuster and changing Hollywood history in the process.By the end of the decade, things were different indeed. We had the launch of HBO, and the nascent rise of cable television networks, whose original programming and uncensored product would both challenge traditional broadcast television and force another metamorphosis. The result: the landmark NBC drama series \"Hill Street Blues,\" a story whose impact would be felt deep into the '80s.But that's another decade.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

The most popular shows of the decade's first half, such as \"All in the Family,\" took on social issues with directness and passion. By the late '70s, however, the biggest hits -- \"Happy Days,\" \"Laverne & Shirley,\" \"The Love Boat\" -- were about nostalgia and escapism.But what do you expect from a decade that went from demonstrations to disco? So much of '70s television is remembered through rose-colored picture tubes these days, but the decade's programming was often mediocre. With just three networks -- ABC, NBC and CBS -- playing to the most mass of mass audiences, excellence was generally the exception, not the rule.

The show found comedy primarily through endless, hilarious confrontations between conservative Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor) and his liberal son-in-law.

The show offered a nostalgic look at the life of teenagers in the 1950s. It ran for 11 seasons and was rated in the top 20 for eight of them. Many people say the show's turning point came in a September 1977 episode, when the Fonz -- a cool, popular character played by Henry Winkler -- water-skis over a shark to help his friend Richie get out of a bad situation. This scene inspired the phrase \"jumping the shark,\" which describes a good thing that takes a downward turn in quality after resorting to something extreme or gimmicky.Hide Caption 26 of 30 Photos: Defining moments in '70s television'Ain't we lucky we got 'em?' \u2013 As \"All in the Family\" led to \"Maude,\" \"Maude\" led to \"Good Times.\" Producer Norman Lear built the spinoff around Maude's housekeeper, played by Ester Rolle, second from left.

Its blend of wealth, power and sex provided a blueprint for popular prime-time soaps that followed, such as \"Falcon Crest\" and \"Dynasty.\"Hide Caption 28 of 30 Photos: Defining moments in '70s televisionFrom alien to star \u2013 Producer Garry Marshall created two successful spinoffs from his hit show \"Happy Days.\" The first, \"Laverne & Shirley,\" starred Garry's sister Penny and \"American Graffiti's\" Cindy Williams as roommates in 1950s Milwaukee. The second spinoff was decidedly stranger: an alien who visits Richie and Fonzie in the '50s returns to Earth (specifically Boulder, Colorado) to observe our culture in the 1970s. Robin Williams played the titular \"Mork from Ork,\" a role that made him an instant star.

On March 24, 1980, the show was renamed \"Nightline.\"Hide Caption 30 of 30It's not for nothing that John Belushi, in auditioning for \"Saturday Night Live\" -- one of the decade's breakthrough shows -- bragged that his television was covered in spit. Read MoreSo if the history of the '70s is a series of mixed messages, here are seven that tell the tale:1. \"All in the Family\"The show revolving around the bigoted, working-class Queens dock foreman Archie Bunker was groundbreaking in countless ways. It made a hero (or antihero) of Archie, played with sympathetic brilliance by Carroll O'Connor, who faced off against wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) and son-in-law Mike Stivic (Rob Reiner) -- and pretty much every social issue of the era.It also made the name of creator Norman Lear, who used the show to establish a series of successful spinoffs, including \"Maude,\" \"Good Times\" and \"The Jeffersons.\" He knew exactly what he was doing.\"I wasn't going to play around with 'Mom dented the car and how are we going to keep Dad from finding out about it,' \" Lear told CNN's \"The Seventies.\"CBS put the show on the air in 1971 -- part of a move to replace rural-skewing programs such as \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" and \"Green Acres\" -- and reaped the benefits. \"All in the Family\" was No. 1 for five straight seasons and brought TV into a new, more adult-oriented era.2. \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"If softer than \"All in the Family,\" its CBS stablemate \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" was equally influential. It was about an unapologetically single woman working as a producer at a Minneapolis TV station -- an unusual subject at a time when housewives were the norm and \"women's liberation,\" as it was called, was still gaining ground.The show was produced by MTM Enterprises, the company created by Moore and her then-husband, Grant Tinker. It established a house style for the many well-crafted MTM shows to follow, including spinoffs \"Rhoda\" and \"Phyllis\" as well as \"The Bob Newhart Show,\" \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" and \"Taxi.\" \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show's\" 1977 conclusion, which featured the cast departing the stage to \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary,\" is still considered one of the great finales.3. \"M*A*S*H\"Though nominally based on the 1970 Robert Altman film, the TV series \"M*A*S*H\" -- which premiered in 1972 -- quickly established its own character. The Korean War doctors of the 4077th MASH unit, led by Hawkeye (Alan Alda) and Trapper John (Wayne Rogers), cracked jokes amid the carnage of war -- and the show didn't shy away from blood, featuring numerous scenes in the camp's operating theater.Later seasons were even more unsentimental. The show dropped its already limited laugh track. Characters were killed off, never to return. One episode was based on actual interviews with Korean War soldiers. Its 1983 finale -- a 2\u00bd-hour movie -- remains the highest-rated regular series episode of all time. \"M*A*S*H\" demonstrated that a TV comedy need not be funny to be effective.4. \"Happy Days\"For the first half of the '70s, CBS was the No. 1 network in America. But when its former programming head, Fred Silverman, went to ABC, he saw a way of drawing viewers from his former employer. Audiences had grown weary of reality, and it was time for escapism.\"Happy Days,\" a show Silverman saved from cancellation, was the perfect example. Set in a cheerful 1950s, \"Happy Days\" celebrated innocence, family and teen spirit, catering to a more youthful audience than CBS' issue-oriented comedies. The breakout character of the show was Arthur \"the Fonz\" Fonzarelli (Henry Winkler), whose big heart belied his look as a leather-jacketed hood. Ayyyyyy!Not only did it spawn successful spinoffs, including \"Laverne & Shirley\" and \"Mork & Mindy,\" it led the way to ABC replacing CBS as TV's top-rated network -- the first time CBS had been bumped since, well, the 1950s.Suddenly, it was a three-network race.5. \"Charlie's Angels\"ABC cemented its dominance with the help of what become known as \"jiggle\" shows, after the scantily clad women who bounced around in them. The No. 1 jiggle show -- featuring three pretty women as bikini-clad detectives -- was \"Charlie's Angels.\" \"Angels\" was produced by Aaron Spelling, whose late '70s run at ABC also included \"The Love Boat\" and \"Fantasy Island.\"  It led to a run of so-called \"T&A\" at the networks, which used any genre excuse -- farce (\"Three's Company\"), adventure (\"Flying High\") even athletics (\"Battle of the Network Stars\") -- to show off actress' figures. For performers -- even male ones -- the trend was difficult to avoid. Asked why he had taken part in \"Battle of the Network Stars,\" LeVar Burton could only smile.\"My only defense was -- it was the '70s,\" he told \"The Seventies.\"6. \"Roots\"Burton was a key part of the most-viewed program of the '70s, the miniseries \"Roots.\" A dramatization of Alex Haley's 1976 memoir, \"Roots\" was aired on eight successive nights in January 1977 -- not because ABC was confident in its material, but because it wasn't. If \"Roots\" flopped, the belief went, at least it would be over quickly.Instead, it became a phenomenon. Families suddenly immersed themselves in genealogy. Colleges built educational programs around the show. In an era before VCRs, the final episode drew more than 130 million viewers, a record.And it put race relations at the fore of the American conversation: In civil rights leader Vernon Jordan's words, \"Roots\" was \"the single most spectacular educational experience in race relations in America.\"The miniseries was nominated for 37 Emmy awards and won nine. A new version is in the works, scheduled for next year. 7. \"Saturday Night Live\"In the late '70s, if ABC was enjoying success as TV's No. 1 network, NBC was a network in decline. The Peacock Network's only major hits were \"Little House on the Prairie\" and \"CHiPs,\" and it was often a laughingstock, thanks to such failures as \"The Montefuscos,\" \"The Waverly Wonders\" and \"Supertrain.\"But the network did have a bright spot in late night, thanks to some \"Not Ready for Prime Time Players.\"\"Saturday Night Live\" debuted October 11, 1975, and immediately captured the zeitgeist. The show's anti-establishment humor made stars of its cast members -- especially Chevy Chase, Belushi and Bill Murray -- and highlighted an absurdist, sharp-edged comedy little seen on network television at the time. \"Television was now in the hands of the television generation,\" TV critic Tom Shales told \"The Seventies.\"Forty years later, \"SNL\" is still going strong. Other shows could have made this list. \"Monday Night Football\" brought sports to prime time. \"Sesame Street\" (which premiered in late '69) revolutionized children's programming. \"Police Story,\" created by author Joseph Wambaugh, was a pioneering police anthology series. \"The Paper Chase,\" which was canceled by CBS and later picked up by Showtime, provided the first example that network failures could succeed on cable.But the next trend was already shaping up. If the '70s were missing anything, it was the serialized drama. A show CBS premiered on April 2, 1978, tried to change that. The show started slowly but started hitting its stride in late 1979 -- and, with its outrageous plotlines, ostentatious displays of wealth and slick production values, became symbolic of the decade to come.It was called \"Dallas.\"JUST WATCHEDThe fight over the 'Family Hour'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe fight over the 'Family Hour' 01:15"}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2015", "month": "6", "day": "11"}, "text": {"headline": "us", "text": "In the spirit of CNN's \"The Seventies\" series, Don Lemon travels to arguably the most influential address in all of American history: 123 Sesame Street", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsWhen \"Sesame Street\" premiered in 1969, it was unlike anything else on televisionCNN's Don Lemon chats it up with some of the most beloved characters  (CNN)In the spirit of CNN's \"The Seventies\" series, Don Lemon travels to arguably the most famous and influential address in all of American history: 123 Sesame Street.After 45 years, it's not an exaggeration to say that \"Sesame Street\" has changed the world.

Nixon has proved an attractive character for actors and comediansAmong those who have played him: Dan Aykroyd, Frank Langella and John Cusack (CNN)Oh, Richard Nixon. Such a character you are.Literally.Perhaps no other modern president has been impersonated, parodied and portrayed so often, and why not? The brilliant and tragic Nixon was positively Shakespearean: jowly, with a swooping nose, guttural voice, unfortunate grin and overeager victory-sign pose, combined with the mind of a chess player and the eyes of an obsessive. \n\n\n\n\n\n<img alt=\"Race for the White House\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160126170046-race-the-white-house-share-card-large-169.jpg\">\n\n\n\n\nCNN's 'Race for the White House,' narrated by Kevin Spacey\n\n\n\n\nAnd that biography. You can't reckon with American history -- especially the history of the '70s -- without reckoning with Richard M. Nixon. He rose quickly -- vice president at age 39 -- crashed abruptly, came back to rise even higher and then went down in the ignominy of Watergate. (Historian Rick Perlstein even titled his chronicle of the '60s and early '70s \"Nixonland.\") The material writes itself. No wonder so many performers have had Nixon to kick around. Here are some of the best who have taken their shot:Read More1. Dan AykroydImpressionists Rich Little and David Frye may have nailed the voice and the mannerisms, but in the \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch \"The Final Days\" (written by Al Franken and Tom Davis), Aykroyd found something deeper and more corrosive. Dan Aykroyd as President Richard Nixon during 'The New Dick' skit on December 2, 1978 The sketch, based on the Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein book, includes a segment in which Nixon talks to the paintings in the White House. \"They're going to find out about you someday,\" he says to a picture of John F. Kennedy. \"Having sex with women -- the president, within these very walls! That never happened when Dick Nixon was in the White House.\" Aykroyd's manic bitterness captured Nixon's dangerous side and also showed that the early \"SNL\" would take no prisoners when it came to politics.  2. Philip Baker Hall If Aykroyd's Nixon is played for some frightening laughs, then Hall's version, in Robert Altman's 1984 film \"Secret Honor,\" is simply frightening. The actor, perhaps better known for his roles in Paul Thomas Anderson films, doesn't look much like the president, but in this one-man show he plows a paranoid energy into the part, acting out a complex psychodrama and bizarre conspiracy theory. 3. Anthony HopkinsHopkins, who won an Oscar for playing serial killer Hannibal Lecter in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" took on the 37th president in Oliver Stone's 1995 film \"Nixon.\" Though he was criticized as over the top (Hopkins \"brings plenty of Hannibal Lecter to Richard Nixon, a man who doesn't really need any more Hannibal Lecter brought to him,\" wrote Alex von Tunzelmann in a 2010 appraisal), he offers some sympathy for the beleaguered president in his portrayal.Actors Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen in Oliver Stone's 1995 film \"Nixon.\" 4. Dan HedayaHedaya played Nixon for laughs in the 1999 film \"Dick,\" a loopy story about two teenage girls who stumble on Watergate and become Deep Throat. Hedaya looks something like the president, though he exaggerates Nixon's tics. Of course, in a movie that features Harry Shearer as G. Gordon Liddy, Will Ferrell as Bob Woodward and Dave Foley as H.R. Haldeman, that's par for the course.5. Harry ShearerSpeaking of Shearer, the longtime voice of \"The Simpsons' \" Mr. Burns has a longtime fascination with Nixon. His series \"Nixon's the One\" recently played on YouTube, and when \"The Simpsons\" needed a Nixon, Shearer's the one who's supplied the voice. (You may remember him from the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Whacking Day.\") Shearer thinks of the president as a \"self-made man, self-destroyed man,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"I think of it as the darkest kind of comedy.\" 6. Billy West\"Futurama,\" which was co-created by \"The Simpsons' \" Matt Groening, also has a Nixon -- a head in a jar who became Earth's president in the year 3000. (His face is also on the $300 and $1000 bills.) In the future, he's a curmudgeonly tyrant, and Billy West, who supplies Nixon's voice, has given him a werewolf-like \"a-roo!\" That touch was inspired by the 1960 presidential debates, West told \"Fresh Air.\"\"I said to my mom: Mom, it looks like he's going to turn into a werewolf, you know, because it was like (Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man) Larry Talbot turning into the werewolf, you know,\" he said. \"That's what it looked like to me. So that's why I gave him that sort of thing.\"7. Frank LangellaIn the movie \"Frost/Nixon,\" Langella emphasized Nixon's slick side, the elder statesman trying to recover his reputation. Langella's Nixon is smooth and clever -- but eventually offers a tight-lipped apology to the American people for Watergate.  Langella said the role, which garned him an Oscar nomination, was a big challenge.\"It took me a long time to figure out how to walk the line,\" he told The New York Times. \"I didn't want to do an impression; I wanted an evocation of him, an essence. And I also knew that whatever I did, I could never satisfy some people, especially the ones who just want to hate Nixon.\" He added, \"But why shouldn't he be human? Why shouldn't he be sympathetic and touching, along with all the rest -- vicious, cruel, a liar and a crook?\" 8. John CusackThe 2013 film \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" concerns the life of a White House butler (Forest Whitaker) over several decades of the 20th century. The portrayals of the various presidents are uneven, and Cusack's Nixon earned a range of reviews.\"Maybe I've just seen 'Say Anything...' too many times, but I couldn't think, for even a second, that Cusack's Nixon was the same guy who gave the Checkers speech or covered up Watergate,\" wrote New York magazine's Jen Chaney. On the other hand, director Daniels loved Cusack's energy.\"John is a caged, rabid animal,\" he told Empire.9. Richard NixonBut perhaps the best Richard Nixon was Nixon himself. He was a man of constant reinvention, an unlikely politician who forced himself into the arena and emerged victorious, only to undo himself.His speeches, such as the Checkers speech or the talk to the Associated Press newspaper editors in which he maintained, \"I am not a crook,\" may be catnip to performers, but the original remains untoppable.What performer could truly do him justice?

That image jolted people around the world. Some say it hastened the end of the Vietnam War.\"I always remember that horrible day that we ran from life to death,\" says Kim Phuc, the girl in that iconic photo. Now 52, she lives just outside Toronto, a wife, mother and survivor inextricably linked to a photograph that dominated front pages in 1972, seven months before the signing of Paris Peace Accords led to the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from South Vietnam.In the beginning, says Phuc, she hated the photo. It embarrassed her. And she struggled with the publicity that surrounded it. For her. it was personal: It captured a moment of torment -- her face frozen in an agonizing wail moments after a napalm attack burned and disfigured her for life.In fact, no one would blame Phuc if she had tried to get as far away from the image as possible. But that is not what she did.Read MoreAfter a long struggle, Phuc came to realize that if her pain and terror had not been captured on film that day, the bombing -- like so many other wartime horrors -- might have been lost to history.She began to think about what the photograph could give, rather than what it could take away.Eventually, the photo became much more than a depiction of a moment in time to Phuc -- it became what she calls \"a path to peace.\"\"I realized that if I couldn't escape that picture, I wanted to go back to work with that picture for peace.

Besides being a loving wife and mother, she is a mentor, and a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations. Every year she travels the world to recount her story of survival, to raise awareness about the brutality of war. In addition to her work with the U.N., Phuc started the Kim Foundation International, a charity that helps children suffering from war, just as she did so many years ago. Its mission is to help the most underprivileged children suffering from war -- building hospitals, schools and homes for children who have been orphaned. Phuc says she plans to live out her life in service of that mission. \"That's why I'm really thankful that I had that picture taken and I can work with that picture for peace.\" Phuc and her husband claimed asylum in Canada more than 20 years ago and have raised two boys there. Phuc says she is very happy in her \"second home\" and gratified that her parents have been able to join her in Canada. Now,  says Phuc, that terrified little girl in the picture is \"not running anymore. She's flying.\"It was not always so. 'I saw a girl, naked ... running'In 1972 Phuc lived in the village of Trang Bang, north of Saigon.  She and family were sheltering in a temple when they heard planes overhead.  Afraid they would be bombed, they ran outside to find safety, just as bombs detonated all around the temple. The bombs delivered napalm, a flammable liquid that clings to human skin, causing horrific burns when ignited. Phuc remembers intense heat and excruciating pain. She pulled burning clothes from her body. She ran.Moments later, a young Associated Press photojournalist took the photograph of his life.  Nick Ut was only 21 years old and already a seasoned war photographer when he arrived at that South Vietnamese village.

Furthermore, removed from their traditional value system, they could be prepared for imposition of consumerism.

The killers were originally given the death penalty, but California later abolished it, reducing their sentences to life. Being locked away, however, did not stop the threat of Manson's mayhem. His followers still believed in his \"Helter Skelter\" message and tried to impress him with their own violent acts. Read MoreThe most noteworthy came on September 5, 1975, when Manson Family member Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme pulled a gun on President Gerald Ford in a failed assassination attempt. As Time magazine wrote in \"The Girl Who Almost Killed Ford,\" it was a chilling reminder that not even those with Secret Service protection are safe from violence in America:Squeaky Fromme's mad act in a Sacramento park with a .45 in her small hand had an immediate, sobering effect on the 1976 presidential election campaign. All too clearly, every candidate could visualize a similar attack being launched against himself. The incident was also a vivid and sickening reminder of one of the most disturbing paradoxes of America: the fact that such a liberal and free society should somehow generate a sprinkling of warped souls who for dark reasons of their own seek to work out their frustrations by destroying political leaders. Zodiac KillerThe Manson Family murders sent a shockwave through Hollywood, but during that same time another killer was terrorizing the San Francisco Bay Area. The Zodiac Killer ushered in a new era of serial killer: one who was smart enough to get away with murder but at the same time wanted the publicity.

In the letters, the killer admitted to murders, threatened more killings and was believed to have given hints at his true identity. Zodiac was believed to have killed at least five people during the late '60s but could be responsible for more since he was never captured.

Before his execution in 1989, Bundy confessed to killing 36 women, but many believe he was responsible for the deaths of 100 or more.David Berkowitz: 'Son of Sam'The killing spree of \"Son of Sam\" in New York was publicized around the world. Beginning in the summer of 1976, six people were killed and seven others wounded by a .44-caliber gun. The murder weapon was the main link police had for the crimes until April 1977 when Berkowitz left his first letter near the scene of a crime. The letter is the first time Berkowitz uses the name \"Son of Sam.\" Berkowitz wrote more letters as \"Son of Sam,\" taunting police about future murders that followed that summer. His victims were usually young women with long dark hair, reports of which caused many New Yorkers to panic, according to the Time article \"Son of Sam Is Not Sleeping.\" Terrified parents in the area are now insisting that their daughters wear their long hair up, bleach it, or have their dates at home. Some girls have decided not to date until the killer is caught, and others are adopting unusual evening wear: loose sweaters and large caps to disguise themselves as males. \"I'm scared,\" said one Queens girl. \"I used to kiss my boyfriend in front of the house, Now I run in.\"Berkowitz was arrested on August 10, 1977, and was sentenced to six life sentences, which he is currently serving.'Hillside Strangler'JUST WATCHEDOn the hunt for the 'Hillside Strangler'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOn the hunt for the 'Hillside Strangler' 01:29Not long after the capture of \"Son of Sam,\" fear began to spread on the other side of the country, in Los Angeles. From October 1977 to February 1978, the bodies of 10 women were found in a hilly area above the city. With no leads, the media began attributing the victims to the \"Hillside Strangler.\" It was only after Kenneth Bianchi was arrested in the killings of two women in Washington that he confessed to the \"Hillside Strangler\" murders and implicated his cousin, Angelo Buono, as his partner in crime. Bianchi and Buono were both sentenced to life in prison without parole. Buono died from a heart attack in 2002.

On November 18, 1978, Jones led more than 900 people to their deaths as they drank cyanide-laced Kool-Aid in Guyana. As Time noted in \"The Lure of Doomsday,\" the event would become a dark bookmark for the decade:The Jonestown story, like some Joseph Conrad drama of fanaticism and moral emptiness, has gone directly into popular myth. It will be remembered as an emblematic, identifying moment of the decade: a demented American psychopomp in a tropical cult house, doling out cyanide with Kool-Aid. Jonestown is the Altamont of the '70s cult movement. Just as Altamont began the destruction of the sweet, vacuous aspirations of Woodstock, Jonestown has decisively contaminated the various vagabond zealotries that have grown up, nourished and sometimes turned sinister.

As a generation of women became liberated in their sexual identities, they wanted that liberation to extend beyond the bedroom.The sex freak-out of the 1970sWomen's equal rights advocates like Gloria Steinem, Susan Brownmiller and Kate Millett emerged and became the faces and voices for a generation. Here are some of the key women and events that helped -- or hindered -- women's liberation throughout the decade.Read MoreFeminism goes mainstreamThe Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which states that \"equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex,\" was originally introduced to Congress in 1923 -- three years after women gained the right to vote -- but never reached the House or Senate floor. The National Organization for Women, which was founded in 1966 and advocated for a \"fully equal partnership of the sexes,\" soon endorsed the ERA and made passing it into the U.S. Constitution a top priority. (The amendment had been unsuccessfully presented to every session of Congress between 1923 and 1970.)However, the ERA was just one part of what the new, \"second-wave\" feminists wanted to accomplish, as TIME's article \"Who's Come a Long Way, Baby?\" from August 31, 1970, points out:\"They want equal pay for equal work, and a chance at jobs traditionally reserved for men only. They seek nationwide abortion reform -- ideally, free abortions on demand. They desire round-the-clock, state-supported child-care centers in order to cut the apron strings that confine mothers to unpaid domestic servitude at home. The most radical feminists want far more. Their eschatological aim is to topple the patriarchal system in which men by birthright control all of society's levers of power -- in government, industry, education, science, the arts.\"In the same article, TIME spotlights Kate Millett, an author who was able to capture the feminist movement's most radical ideology into a book that became a must-read for any supporter.JUST WATCHED'Hugh Hefner is my enemy'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Hugh Hefner is my enemy' 01:49\"Until this year, however, with the publication of a remarkable book called 'Sexual Politics,' the movement had no coherent theory to buttress its intuitive passions, no ideologue to provide chapter and verse for its assault on patriarchy. Kate Millett, 35, a sometime sculptor and longtime brilliant misfit in a man's world, has filled the role through 'Sexual Politics.' \" 'Reading the book is like sitting with your testicles in a nutcracker,' says George Stade, assistant professor of English at Columbia University. He should know; the book was Kate's Ph.D. thesis, and he was one of her advisers.\" What gender equality would look likeGloria Steinem's 1969 New York Magazine article \"After Black Power, Women's Liberation\" also brought nationwide attention to the women's movement. The following year, she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and TIME published her essay on what a world with gender equality would look like. In \"What It Would Be Like If Women Win,\" from August 31, 1970, Steinem writes:\"In Women's Lib Utopia, there will be free access to good jobs -- and decent pay for the bad ones women have been performing all along, including housework. Increased skilled labor might lead to a four-hour workday, and higher wages would encourage further mechanization of repetitive jobs now kept alive by cheap labor. ... Schools and universities will help to break down traditional sex roles, even when parents will not. Half the teachers will be men, a rarity now at preschool and elementary levels; girls will not necessarily serve cookies or boys hoist up the flag.\"The 51% minorityThe women's movement attracted women of all races, backgrounds and political beliefs because many of them felt that they were being treated like second-class citizens. Despite making up more than half the American population, women were not admitted to colleges at the same rate as men or allowed equal pay or job opportunities. As the feminist wave swept across the country, the support for ERA picked up even more steam. The amendment was passed by both houses of Congress and President Richard Nixon in 1972, and was sent off to be ratified into law by the states. At the end of 1973, the ERA only needed five more states to ratify it by March 1979 in order to get the three-fourths approval it required.Women as 'Man of the Year'Mid-decade, the women's liberation movement had inundated America. The changes were so rampant that TIME awarded its \"Man of the Year\" in 1975 to \"American women.\" Their article \"Great Changes, New Chances, Tough Choices\" from January 5, 1976, reads:\"They have arrived like a new immigrant wave in male America. They may be cops, judges, military officers, telephone linemen, cab drivers, pipefitters, editors, business executives -- or mothers and housewives, but not quite the same subordinate creatures they were before. Across the broad range of American life, from suburban tract houses to state legislatures, from church pulpits to Army barracks, women's lives are profoundly changing, and with them, the traditional relationships between the sexes. ...1975 was not so much the Year of the Woman as the Year of the Women -- an immense variety of women altering their lives, entering new fields, functioning with a new sense of identity, integrity and confidence.\"Phyllis SchlaflyThen, feminism hit a roadblock: Her name was Phyllis Schlafly. Schlafly, a staunch conservative, began speaking to the women who felt that the feminist movement was not for them -- women who enjoyed their roles as mothers and housewives. Schlafly, who was known to open her speeches by thanking her husband for letting her attend because \"it irritates the women's libbers,\" rallied together the anti-ERA crowd. In Schlafly's eyes, the ERA would strip away any protections that women had, like child support and exemption from the military draft. TIME notes this in their article \"Great Changes, New Chances, Tough Choices\" from January 5, 1976:JUST WATCHEDThe fight for women's rightsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe fight for women's rights 02:25\"The sweeping simplicity of the amendment -- 'Equality of rights under law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex' -- made many voters, especially women, nervous. The anti-ERA lobby, led by Phyllis Schlafly -- a conspicuously liberated woman who at 51 is working for a law degree -- conjured up the prospect of unisex public toilets, an end to alimony, women forced into duty as combat soldiers.\"National Women's ConferenceIn January 1977, Indiana became the 35th state to ratify the ERA. The amendment was now only three states shy of becoming law, but the effort was losing momentum. Many feminists saw the National Women's Conference in November 1977 as a chance to breathe new life into it. More than 14,000 women gathered to discuss the problems facing women and formulate a plan of action to deliver to President Carter. As the \"What Next for U.S. Women\" TIME article from December 5, 1977, shows, the conference was a chance for many women on the fringe of the movement to finally become a part of it:\"Ida Castro, from New Jersey: 'It was a total high to get together and discover so many people who agree on so many issues, and finding that I am not alone.'\"Sharon Talbot, a 19-year-old Smith College student, put it, 'I didn't have to be a radical to be a feminist. Before I went, I hadn't really decided where I stood. Now I know that all those other women feel the same way I do, so if they call themselves feminists, or whatever, then that's what I am too.' \"Ultimately, more radical hot button issues like abortion and gay rights drove a wedge in the conference.\"During a conference vote favoring abortion, one woman cried, 'I never thought they would come to this. It's murder!' Said another: 'It will be old people next.'\"Dorris Holmes, a Georgia delegate, said 'Lesbianism has been an albatross on the whole movement since the last century. It is an extra burden we do not need.' \"The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rightsWhile the National Women's Conference was taking place, Phyllis Schlafly was leading a counter rally of \"pro-family\" supporters. \"The Equal Rights proponents,\" she charged, \"want to reconstruct us into a gender-free society, so there's no difference between men and women. I don't think babies need two sex-neutral parents. I think they need a father and a mother.\"Many women left feeling more empowered than ever before, but the momentum did not translate into more votes for the ERA. After Indiana, no other state voted for its ratification. TIME also noted that during the conference \"American women had reached some kind of watershed in their own history, and in that of the nation.\"Steinem and other movement leaders expressed a similar sentiment.\"In terms of real power -- economic and political -- we are still just beginning. But the consciousness, the awareness -- that will never be the same,\" Steinem said.

In 2003, she was beatified.Hide Caption 71 of 71There also was sexual liberation, which had something to do with women liberating themselves in the bedroom, too, but had as much to do with loosening norms around sex.  In 1960, half of 19-year-old women who were unmarried had not yet had sex.  By the late 1980s, as Nancy Cohen pointed out, two-thirds of all women had done the deed by age 18. Cohen also noted that the invention of the birth control pill in the 1960s helped pave the way.  Within five years after the first pill went on the market in 1960, 6 million American women were taking it. These women and others, and their male partners, entered the next decade literally with a radically different experience of sex and freedom.  The year 1972 alone saw the publication of such groundbreaking books as \"The Joy of Sex\" and \"Open Marriage.\"Read MoreThe '70s also brought nonheterosexual sex into the spotlight.  In 1969, when a gay bar in New York was raided by police, protests erupted and what became known as the Stonewall Riots was the formative moment of the gay rights movement that would continue to grow into the next decades. For gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans, the 1970s was an era of increasing awakening and visibility, as well as backlash and persecution. In 1970, the first gay pride parade was held to commemorate the Stonewall Riots, and in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association finally saw fit to remove homosexuality from its official list of mental disorders.  Arguably, one of the quintessential songs of the 1970s captures all perspectives on the sexual revolution.  \"Aaaaaah, FREAK OUT!\" sang the band, Chic, in their 1978 chart topper.  While the old guard was certainly freaking out about the quickly and wildly shifting terrain of traditional American values, those doing the shifting were enjoying the ride.  The song almost mocks those who are actually freaking out, turning their angst into a dance craze.  \"Come on along and have a real good time,\" Chic invites.  That moral ground you feel shifting below you?  Think of it more as a sensual undulating and get with the groove. JUST WATCHEDThe fight for women's rightsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe fight for women's rights 02:25It's easy to look back and see the boundaries of the era's aspirations. The Vietnam War, in the 1970s, and AIDS, in the 1980s, killed people and rightfully became preoccupying life-and-death issues. Complete sexual liberation and the brave new peaceful world a generation longed for ran headlong into hard and brutal reality. In hindsight, the movements of the 1970s were much more about cultural triumphs than they were about legal and political changes.  That the idea of women's equality is more widely accepted today than it was 40 years ago is a victory.  Yet the fact that women still earn a fraction of what men earn on average, and women of color even less, that rape and sexual assault remain so prevalent, that access to birth control and abortion and sex education are so actively still contested \u2014 these are reminders of how far we have yet to go. \"In the 1970s the sexual revolution was really mostly about sex,\" wrote Hanna Rosin.  \"But now the sexual revolution has deepened into a more permanent kind of power for women.\"  Or, more accurately I think, at least a sense of personal power.  But empowerment hasn't necessarily translated into real economic and political leverage.  Are there more women running major companies, transgender men and women starring in Hollywood productions, parents nurturing their children's healthy sexuality and now the nationwide right to marriage equality?  Yes!  But all around us \u2014 from the Bill Cosby story to campus rape to the killing of Kristina Gomez Reinwald, one of many transgender murder victims \u2014 there are almost daily reminders of the reality of subjugation based on gender, race and sexuality.  Without a doubt, women and gay people, but straight men, too, experienced more individual freedom in the 1970s. But that doesn't mean we are all liberated.  Just like one black president or one female president doesn't mean there's no more racism or sexism. Thus perhaps the greatest legacy of the 1970s wasn't that it set us on a path to a destination \u2014 one we clearly haven't reached yet\u2014 but that it defined desire, desire not only for individual, bodily autonomy, self-expression and pleasure but a desire that society fully reflect and respect our freedom.  Wherever we are now, with respect to women's rights and LGBT rights and sexual freedom, is a direct result of the 1970s.  And the fact that we're not satisfied yet is also the legacy of that era.

That was far from the case.", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsMore than 10 years after her death, Linda Lovelace remains a porn iconOver the course of her career, she embraced and denounced \"Deep Throat\"Some, like Larry Flynt, believe Lovelace was used as a sex slave by her husband (CNN)More than 10 years after her death, Linda Lovelace probably remains America's best known porn star (apologies to Jenna Jameson and Traci Lords). It's an unlikely distinction given that Lovelace -- by her own estimation -- only spent a total of two and a half weeks working in the adult film industry.But those two and a half weeks included shooting \"Deep Throat,\" the X-rated film that turned into a pop culture phenomenon after its release in 1972. It became the first adult film to cross over to mainstream audiences, earning an astounding $600 million.There are many reasons the film became such a breakout hit. Some have described \"Deep Throat\" as the first porno film that attempted to tell a story, albeit a ludicrous one.\" 'Deep Throat' had a plot,\" said Darwin Porter, author of \"Inside Linda Lovelace's Deep Throat: Degradation, Porno Chic and the Rise of Feminism.\" \"I mean, not a great plot, but a plot.\"It had certain comedy overtones to it, too, and this was very unusual and bizarre (for a porno film at that time),\" Porter told CNN.Read MorePorter says \"Deep Throat\" also benefited from a legal and moral crusade waged against the film.  \"So many people wanted to ban (the film), beginning with the government and certainly Mayor John Lindsay of New York,\" Porter said.  \"When (Lindsay) banned it in New York, he made the movie famous all over America.\"Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt offers a more straightforward explanation for the film's broad appeal. He told CNN it amounted to fascination with Lovelace's gift for a particular sex act suggested by the film's title.Flynt told CNN, \"I think it's the unique talent shown during the film is what piqued a lot of excitement.\"The huge success of \"Deep Throat\" might lead some people to imagine that its star led a charmed life.  But that was far from the case, to judge from the recent biopic, \"Lovelace,\" starring Amanda Seyfried in the title role.The film actually presents its audience with two versions of the Lovelace story. For most of the film, she is shown as being manipulated into porn by her then-husband, Chuck Traynor. But in an darker version of events shown toward the film's end from Lovelace's point of view, she is depicted as essentially a sex slave.Neither scenario is a happy one. Flynt, who says he knew Lovelace and Traynor, seems to believe the darker version.\"She was just being used every step of the way,\" he told CNN. \"It wasn't something where she'd wake up every morning and think, 'I can't wait to get to work in the morning.'  That wasn't the situation.\"Flynt said Traynor prostituted Lovelace, forcing her to make adult films.JUST WATCHED'Hugh Hefner is my enemy'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Hugh Hefner is my enemy' 01:49\"That type of coercion did exist,\" he said. \"I think she was being very much controlled by Chuck (Traynor). ... That's why I refer to him as a pimp.\"But not everyone sees the matter as that black and white, including actor Chris Noth, who plays \"Deep Throat\" producer Anthony Romano in \"Lovelace.\"\"I'm not clear if she was totally pushed into it,\" Noth told CNN. \"In the scope of what you can read and see about her, it's hard to believe that situation in totality.\"Porter believes Lovelace was coerced into doing porn \"to a degree.\" The author says Lovelace demonstrated considerably more free will during the three years after \"Deep Throat,\" during which, he says, the actress capitalized on her fame to run with a celebrity crowd.  \"She dated the top stars of Hollywood, and nobody forced her to do that,\" Porter said. Porter claims many a Hollywood luminary -- including John Wayne, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin -- was eager to ascertain whether Lovelace's sexual technique lived up to the legend.Porter says it was another member of the Rat Pack who helped her make the rounds of Hollywood's A-list.  \"Sammy Davis Jr. did more than anyone to make her the queen of porno chic,\" Porter said. \"He suggested that the 'in thing' to do was to have a date with Linda Lovelace.

She divorced Traynor, married another man, raised a family and lived, in her words, as a \"typical housewife.\"For a time, she publicly campaigned for the elimination of pornography. \"Linda Lovelace became a spokesman for the anti-pornography movement,\" Porter noted. \"She was adopted by the leading feminists, the most important of whom was Gloria Steinem.\"This phase of Lovelace's life was to have been portrayed in the biopic. Demi Moore was cast to play Steinem, but she dropped out. The part then went to Sarah Jessica Parker, but her scenes were later cut from the film.Lovelace later split with the feminists. \"Linda felt that ultimately she was being used by them,\" Porter said.

During a two-year investigation, the FBI set up a sting operation dubbed \"Abscam,\" videotaping politicians accepting bribes from a phony Arabian company in return for favors. The sting resulted in the conviction of six U.S. representatives, one senator, a mayor from New Jersey and members of the Philadelphia City Council. The operation was the inspiration for David O.

Share your photo here (CNN)If you could sum up the '80s in a sentence, you might say: \"Did that really happen?\" Of course, the trends of any time period always look woefully outdated a few decades down the road, but there was something special about the '80s: The hair was bigger, the world was younger, and everything seemed to operate on a completely different level of weird. Here are just a few examples:Everyone's favorite romantic movie was about two teenage cousins \"Blue Lagoon\" was a movie based on a classic and not-at-all-questionable love story featuring naked teenage cousins (Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins) who are marooned on an island and left to work out their budding sexuality while caring for their accidentally conceived child. Read MoreBrooke Shields and Christopher Atkins in a scene from the 1980 film, \"Blue Lagoon.\" Oh, and Brooke Shields was 14 years old when it was filmed. Unsurprisingly, much of the viewing public took issue with seeing an IRL young teenager walk around with her breasts barely covered, doing pretend sex with another IRL teenager. There was plenty to add to the creepiness factor: The whole cousin thing was a bit much for the time (now it's practically precious, thanks to \"Game of Thrones\"), and director Randall Kleiser has said he taped Shields' picture above Atkins' bed so Atkins would fall in love with her. After all the controversy, the movie ended up being lambasted by critics. Your mom really didn't want you to play Dungeons and DragonsBy today's standards, playing Dungeons and Dragons is a fairly innocuous marker of low-level nerd-dom. In the '80s, though, the table-top role-playing game was seen by some as a work of the devil himself, to be played by only the most disturbed and unsupervised of children. Groups of religious fundamentalists decried the growing popularity of the game, saying the imagery of mythical beings and pseudo-religious figures represented the \"occult.\" READ MORE: D&D still inspires, 40 years laterA small number of teen suicides were even blamed on the game by grieving parents, and in 1983 one of these parents started \"BADD,\" a knock-off of MADD that stood for \"Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons.\" People actually fought each other over Cabbage Patch Kids dollsCabbage Patch kids were all the rage in the 1980sThe Cabbage Patch craze may go down as one of America's greatest mysteries. Here are supposedly normal, sane human beings coming to blows over something that looks like a potato with eyes.Have there been countless inexplicable fads since? Of course (we haven't forgotten you, POGs). But the Cabbage Patch insanity was the perfect alchemy of consumer hysteria and creepy soft-sculpted charm. Coke tried to sell us \"New Coke\" In 1985, as Coke saw some of its sales flip to the Pepsi camp, the company \"reinvented\" the original formula. They marketed it as the \"New taste of Coke,\" and people hated it. Within months, Coke reversed back to the now-\"Classic\" formula and actually saw a rise in sales. It's kind of like when an actor says they're retiring or a celebrity says they're quitting Twitter, and their publicity skyrockets before they all of a sudden change their minds. The switcheroo may have given Coke a little bit of a boost, but it's historically seen as a cheap move. You could smoke on airplanes Ah the joys of flying in the '80s: Tickets may have cost a lot more than today, but you could light up to your heart's content. That's right! They even had little ashtrays in the armrests. While it was all great news for smokers, those left in the \"non-smoking\" section couldn't really avoid getting caught up in the smog, especially on longer flights.  By 1990, smoking was banned on nearly all domestic flights -- although you could still light up on many international airlines. (Fun fact: Even after the 1990 ban, pilots were still allowed to smoke in the cockpit so they wouldn't experience nicotine withdrawal while flying.) Shows like \"Alf\" and \"Bosom Buddies\" were allowed on TVIt's no secret the '80s were a time of nightmare television. When else could a show about a cat-eating puppet alien not only be allowed to air, but actually become a cultural touchstone with a full line of merchandising? Children's series were particularly scarring -- no therapist could ever remove the memories of Rubik the anthropomorphic troll cube -- but prime-time programming was almost as bad. Tom Hanks has probably spent his entire career trying to atone for \"Bosom Buddies,\" in which he dressed in drag to pass for a lady so he could live in a low-rent apartment. Oh, or how about \"Small Wonder\"? Sure, robot child hostages are always cool!  The Olympics were boycotted (more than once) A choreographed show from the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics.In 1980, the United States straight up didn't go to the Summer Olympics at all because the games were being held in the Soviet capital of Moscow and the USSR had refused President Jimmy Carter's call to abandon the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Japan, West Germany, and Canada were among the countries to join in the boycott. All in all, 65 countries that were invited chose not to participate in the Moscow games, for one reason or another. The Soviet Union boycotted the following Summer Olympics because the 1984 games were being held in -- yes, you guessed it -- the United States (Los Angeles, to be exact). The Chicago Bears gave us the \"Super Bowl Shuffle\" Chicago Bears players film the music video for the Super Bowl Shuffle in 1985.    In the age of viral advertising, a professional sports team recording a corny rap song about themselves is a fairly precise formula for Internet gold. How prescient, then, that the Chicago Bears did exactly this in 1985, when they released the \"Super Bowl Shuffle,\" the greatest recording in the history of sound. Not since Orpheus plucked his lyre before Hades has there been a purer musical embodiment of the human experience. And -- since this was the '80s -- they also recorded a stunning music video.The song became a hit and was even nominated for a Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Performance by a duo or group. Please, relive it here:The magic must have wafted up to the ears of fate herself, because the Bears won the Super Bowl in 1986, trouncing the New England Patriots 46-10."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2016", "month": "4", "day": "21"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "The '80s brought their own special sauce to movies about the Cold War with premises that were hilarious and almost unbelievable.

Why? Because by the time the Decade of Excess rolled around, America and the Soviets had been superpower rivals for more than 30 years already. Tinseltown was ready for new ideas that would fill theater seats. No story lines were off limits, including outrageous comedy and exaggerated drama.See what you think about my list of five top Cold War films from the '80s:1. 'Red Dawn' (1984) Premise: What if the Soviets invaded America? What if high school kids fought them from mountain hideouts? Read MoreWhat made it so good: Written by Hollywood mad dog John MiIius, the crazy nightmare scenario of this drama seems so unbelievable in retrospect it borders on the ridiculous. Best line: \"Not bad for a bunch of kids, huh? Mama would be real proud.\"Fun Fact: When I interviewed Milius in 2009, he told me he spent some of his younger days hunting and camping in the mountains. For Milius, \"Red Dawn\" was kind of his sick fantasy film. \"We were promised, when I was growing up, this war with Russia,\" he said. \"We were promised World War III.\" He almost sounded disappointed that it never happened. Cheese factor: An armed Soviet paratrooper lands at an American school. A teacher approaches him as he draws his rifle. The teacher walks toward the Soviet invader saying, \"What's going on here my friend?\" The Soviet opens fire on the teacher. Not too smart. Surprise: A young Lea Thompson and pre-\"Dirty Dancing\" Jennifer Grey show they know their way around a loaded Russian Kalashnikov. As they say in the movie, \"Wolverines!\"2. 'Firefox' (1982) Premise: Before there was Firefox the browser, there was the movie. In this spy thriller, Clint Eastwood plays a retired Air Force fighter pilot who must sneak into the Soviet Union to steal a jet fighter codenamed Firefox. This airplane is so fast it flies six times the speed of sound. It's so technologically advanced it can be operated by the pilot's thought commands. Eastwood's character is chosen for the mission because he's a top American pilot who knows how to speak Russian. What made it so good: The story rocks because it comes from Craig Thomas' 1977 best-seller. The special effects from John Dykstra, who brought us Oscar-winning effects for the original \"Star Wars,\" helped make this movie a sweet adventure ride at the mall movie theater.Best line: \"Yeah I can fly it. I'm the best there is.\" -- Maj. Mitchell Gant, USAF (Clint Eastwood)Fun fact: The Firefox jet in the film resembles a real plane -- the North American XB-70 Valkyrie at the Museum of the USAF in Ohio. Surprise: Actor John Ratzenberger, who later went on to fame playing Cliff Clavin in TV's \"Cheers,\" has a small role in the film. 3. 'The Falcon and the Snowman' (1985)Premise: This drama centers around a disillusioned defense employee who conspires with his boyhood drug dealer friend to sell U.S. intelligence information to the Soviets. Before there was Edward Snowdon, there was Christopher Boyce. What made it so good: Timothy Hutton's portrayal of Boyce as he learns the ugly truth of global intelligence warfare makes it worth seeing.  This is one of Sean Penn's best early film performances in a dramatic role. Bonus: a great soundtrack by David Bowie as well as the Pat Metheny Group.Best line: \"They're just as paranoid and dangerous as we are. I don't know why I ever thought any differently.\" \u2014 Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton)4. 'Spies Like Us' (1985)Premise: A comedy about two U.S. government officials who are duped into a undercover decoy mission to Afghanistan where they end up having to try and stop a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviets.What made it so good: One of Chevy Chase's best ever performances (watch the classic exam scene). He and fellow SNL alum Dan Aykroyd make this fast moving comedy work. Aykroyd's hilarious script is packed with far out ideas including the funniest we-saved-the-planet-from-World-War-Three scene, ever. Bonus: a drive-in theater that doubles as a secret satellite weapons ground station.Best line: \"When we commissioned the Schmectel Corporation to research this precise event sequence scenario, it was determined that the continual stockpiling and development of our nuclear arsenal was becoming self-defeating. A weapon unused is a useless weapon.\" \u2014 Gen. Sline (Steve Forrest)Fun fact: Aykroyd's real-life wife, actress Donna Dixon, appears in the film. Surprise: Hollywood comedian Bob Hope's cameo in this movie was his final appearance in a film, according to IMDb.com.5. 'Rocky IV' (1985)Premise: Soviet boxer Ivan Drago kills Rocky Balboa's best friend Apollo Creed during a boxing match. Seeking revenge, Rocky travels to Moscow to fight Drago in front of the whole world. What made it so good: This was '80s gold for three reasons.      a. It was Sylvester Stallone's love letter to the country that made him rich and famous.      b. It portrayed the Cold War as a classic mano a mano competition between two men.      c. It featured a performance by the hardest working man in show business, James Brown, singing his top five hit \"Living in America.\" And it memorialized Dolph Lungren's Ivan Drago, truly one of the scariest antagonists Stallone's character has ever faced. Best line: \"I must break you\" -- Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) Fun fact: It was the highest grossing sports movie of all time until 2009, according to Guinness, raking in $300 million.Cheese factor: The music montage scene when Rocky trains for the big fight at a remote site in the Russian countryside using old farm implements. I don't know if Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev ever saw this heart-pounding propaganda slugfest, but if he did, he should have saved us all a lot of time and just gone ahead and torn down that wall a couple of years early.

She was the first person he hired for what would become his groundbreaking sketch comedy team, which was dubbed  \"The Not Ready For Prime Time Players,\" in 1975. Despite that original sketch team's legendary star power -- Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris and Laraine Newman -- Radner stood out. Her quirky characters became household names: Roseanne Roseannadanna, the loud-mouthed consumer affairs reporter on \"Weekend Update\"; Baba Wawa, Radner's parody of Barbara Walters; Lisa Loopner, the lovable geek from \"The Nerds\" sketches; and Emily Litella, the hard-of-hearing elderly woman who appeared in op-ed segments for \"Weekend Update.\"In the CNN Film \"Love Gilda,\" it's clear Radner inspired countless comics, both men and women.Read More\"You see Amy Poehler, Cecily Strong and Maya Rudolph talking about her in the film,\" Alan Zweibel, Radner's close friend and \"SNL\" writing partner, tells CNN. \"Even Bill Hader spoke about her with reverence, growing up and watching her. They looked upon Gilda as someone who was a gateway, who was a pioneer for women in sketch comedy in particular and comedy in general.\"She helped break down barriers \"SNL\" has changed a lot over the decades and much of that can be attributed to Radner helping break down barriers for women in comedy. During her time, she had to fight against stereotypes and the rampant sexism that was almost the norm in show business. Even Belushi, who was arguably the biggest star on \"SNL\" at the time, believed women were \"fundamentally not funny\" and he actively worked to undermine female staff writers, according to Curtin.Watch CNN Films' 'Love, Gilda,\" nowJust like Radner used to say, \"It's always something\" \u2014 if it ain't a star like Belushi, it's someone else.\"To be a woman on that show was extremely different than when I was there,\" Amy Poehler says in \"Love, Gilda.\" \"There was so much in the world that had yet to be carved out for women in not just comedy.\"Throughout its history, \"SNL\" has dealt with claims of sexism of being a boy's club. The ratio of male to female staff writers was stark for much of the show's early history, which had an impact on the types of sketches that made it to air. With more male writers penning material, there were more parts written for the men.

Fey also made up one-half of the first all-female \"Weekend Update\" duo alongside Poehler. All this would not have been possible if it were not for Radner, Curtin, Newman and the early female staff writers laying the groundwork.\"By the time I got there, in that read-through room ... our director was a woman, one of our stage managers was a woman,\" Fey told Oprah Winfrey in an interview. Fey described the system at \"SNL\" as being \"very fair,\" with everyone having the opportunity for their sketches to be heard and given a chance to make it to broadcast.Some of the most influential women in comedy today -- Fey, Poehler and Melissa McCarthy, to name a few -- all owe their careers, in part, to Radner. Not only did she make it acceptable for women to cross boundaries in comedy previously only crossed by men, she gave young women a role model.\"Gilda was a superb role model and inspiration for female comedians and performers,\" Aykroyd tells CNN. \"Her legacy is the array of giant female talents who, motivated by Gilda, worked to audition and get on 'SNL.' All of the female cast members since Gilda would agree that their own careers are part of Gilda's legacy.\"Gilda Radner, left, as Roseanne Roseannadanna, with Jane Curtin during \"SNL's\" \"Weekend Update.\" What made Gilda Gilda While Radner served as an inspiration to many, you could see shades of Lucille Ball in the way she performed. In some ways, Radner could very well be considered the Ball of her generation. She had a distinct walk; Aykroyd described her as \"a puppet with frozen knees and elbows.\" But she was a master of physicality, and there have been very few, if any women in comedy who have been able to match her level of physicality since.\"Gilda would just give herself up to a moment, she really gave herself up, she sacrificed herself,\" Bill Murray said in \"Live from New York.\" \"She knew how to serve a scene or another person in the scene just so devotedly. She really had the most of that of anyone. As a result, because she made other people look good, she herself looked fantastic.\"A number of cast members were nominated for Emmys over the decades, but Radner was one of only three in the show's history to win an Emmy for outstanding individual performance in a variety or music program. (Chevy Chase and Dana Carvey are the other two.) Considering the roster of talented people who have appeared on \"SNL\" throughout the years, it's a testament to her abilities as a performer. Even Poehler says that she \"basically stole pretty much all of my characters from Gilda.\"Whether she was trading barbs with Curtin on \"Weekend Update\" or fighting off a noogie from Murray in one of the \"Nerds\" sketches, Radner elevated any performance she was in. Average sketches became good and good sketches became great. When all else failed, the audience could always turn to Radner for a laugh.\"I think that she's probably got one of the highest batting averages in \"SNL\" history,\" says James Andrew Miller, co-author of \"Live from New York.\" \"She always delivered. Even when a sketch went sideways or wasn't particularly brilliantly written, there was just something so compelling and appealing about her that she was enough to capture your attention.\"'She showed her soul'Aside from all her memorable characters, part of what made Radner so compelling as a performer was that she was relatable. She was transparent about her own vulnerabilities, which made her endearing to the audience.\"I think that she showed her soul,\" Zweibel says. \"People related to her. Yeah, she was on television, but she had questions about guys, questions about being out there in the world as a woman. She was very revealing. There were very few secrets that she withheld from the public. It's like the audience knew her.\"Radner used comedy to be in control of her situation, and she even joked about her battle with stage 4 ovarian cancer when it was in remission during her final TV appearance on \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\" in 1988, which was unheard of at the time.This fearlessness served Radner well as she helped reshape the comedy landscape.\"So much of what \"SNL\" is today is a result of that unbelievable five years of consistency, and Gilda was a huge part of that,\" Miller says. \"In terms of laying the foundation for the show, I think she was vital and instrumental in building up a show that was so great it could stand the test of time.\"Gilda Radner's career brought the world joy, while sadly ending in tragedy. Before she died of cancer in 1989 at age 42, she reminded us that life comes with both the good and the bad. That idea may have been the deeper meaning behind, \"If it's not one thing, it's another.\"As Gilda so succinctly put it, \"It's always something.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2017", "month": "6", "day": "6"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "A  \"Friends\" revival may be a dream for the show's biggest fans, but it appears to be a nightmare for at least one of its stars.", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsPerry worries that a \"Friends\" reunion will fall flatIt's a sentiment shared by fellow star Jennifer Aniston (CNN)A  \"Friends\" revival may be a dream for the show's biggest fans, but it appears to be a nightmare for at least one of its stars.Matthew Perry is having some sleepless nights over how well received a new \"Friends\" show would be.\"When I'm asleep, I have this nightmare that we do 'Friends' again and nobody cares,\" Perry told Variety in an interview published on Monday. \"We do a whole series, we come back, and nobody cares about it.\"That won't stop fans for asking for it, especially with all the reboots of popular shows such as \"Twin Peaks,\" \"Arrested Development\" and \"Gilmore Girls.\"It's a frequent request of the cast which along with Perry included Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer.Read MoreIn December Aniston told ITV that fans shouldn't count on a reunion.\"I don't know what we would do,\" she said. \"I think that period of time was sort of nostalgic, you know?\"Related: Jennifer Aniston dashes 'Friends' reunion hopesPerry echoed that sentiment and said if anyone asks him he will say no.\"The thing is: We ended on such a high,\" he said. \"We can't beat it.

Actually, yes, says TV critic Eric Deggans. Of the many flaws of '60s entertainment TV, he says, a major one was that it didn't reflect what was going on in America, whether it was the civil rights movement or the escalation of the Vietnam War.\"Back then, there was a lot of TV that was created by producers who really underestimated the audience,\" Deggans says. New Day: 5 things Dick Cavett misses about '60s TV (including: No Kardashians)As the decade continued, television gingerly addressed some social change but certainly nothing like what was to come -- first in the 1970s with such Norman Lear sitcoms as \"All in the Family\" and \"Sanford and Son\" and in more recent years, novelistic shows such as \"Breaking Bad.\"TV: The new, new golden ageIn fact, Deggans says even today's widely popular sitcoms and dramas, such as \"Parenthood,\" engage with real life in ways that were forbidden 50 years ago. That's true even with \"The Walking Dead,\" an end-of-the-world horror show about zombies. \"What it's really about is man's inhumanity to man, and when something happens and all the chips are down, how do you respond as a human being?\" he says, referring to \"The Walking Dead.\" \"When you think about what's going on in Nigeria or the Arab Spring or Syria, that's real life.\"Moreover, even the more formulaic shows don't take their viewers for granted.\"I don't think any of those shows pander to their audience in the way that a show like 'Petticoat Junction' or 'Gilligan's Island' did,\" he says. \"Those were classic comedies, but they were really, really simple. A show like 'NCIS' is absolutely about all these issues we're struggling with as a society.\" Ironically, Minow's 1961 speech was somewhat taken out of context. He actually praised the medium before lowering the boom: \"When television is good, nothing -- not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers -- nothing is better,\" he said. His concern that TV wasn't properly serving the public is what prompted his criticism. Indeed, the speech was titled \"Television in the Public Interest.\"The last half-century has been mostly positive, says Minow today -- and he observes that the federal government played a positive role in that growth. Minow, now 88 and an attorney in Chicago, was instrumental in requiring television sets to include a UHF dial and promoting the use of communications satellites.\"I felt that the basic role of the government was to expand choice, because the government should not be in the business of deciding what's on the air,\" he says. \"I think the expansion of choice was the government's main contribution.\"He does have some concerns, however, about the increasing consolidation of the communications industry over the last 50 years. \"I think the idea of having local ownership has pretty much disappeared,\" he says. But he shrugs, \"The horse is out of the barn.\"Massive mergers planned for TV providersDeggans notes, however, that despite the corporatization of media, there's still a much broader range than in the '60s -- or even in the '90s. After all, 50 years ago we had three networks. Now there's cable, the Internet is a major player allowing for video streaming, and technology lets anybody \"broadcast themselves,\" to borrow YouTube's old slogan. They can choose when to watch, too.Yes, TV is still belittled. But the argument flows both ways. After his speech, Minow was tweaked by \"Gilligan's Island\" producer Sherwood Schwartz, who made the FCC chairman the namesake of a certain shipwrecked boat. Minow appreciated the gesture.\"I told him I considered it a great compliment,\" he says. \"It exposed my name to two generations of television viewers.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2014", "month": "5", "day": "30"}, "text": {"headline": "showbiz", "text": "It's hard for today's generation to imagine watching TV in the 1960s.

You watched what the networks put on and that was it.  And oh yeah, there were only three channels.  Yet television made some groundbreaking advancements in this decade as we learned from this week's episode of \"The Sixties,\"  and here are a few of them:1. Television becomes a political force By 1960, most American households had a television, and that year's Nixon/Kennedy debate was the first televised presidential debate. For many Americans, it was their first introduction to John F. Kennedy. When Kennedy was approached about the idea of debating his political opponent on television, he agreed immediately. Kennedy was comfortable on-camera and sure he'd win. Nixon, however, began to sweat during the televised debate, and the American people began to doubt him.No one realized just how much TV mattered until after those 1960 debates. Later that election season, Kennedy appeared as a guest on NBC's \"The Jack Parr Tonight Show\"; and when Nixon ran for president again in 1968, he made a brief appearance on the sketch comedy show \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" and uttered the show's famous catchphrase, \"Sock it to me.\" It was the first time a presidential candidate had appeared on a comedy show.

The rise of TV journalism Before the Kennedy presidency, television was far behind print journalism in terms of sources audiences relied upon for news. But soon, people relied on TV news for the day's headlines as well as information on American troops in Vietnam, particularly the numbers of those killed or wounded. When something major happened on TV, it affected the whole country at the same exact time.TV news was the polar opposite of entertainment TV. The civil rights era, the JFK assassination and the space race all unfolded on TV.As David Brinkley stated, \"Television showed the American people TO the American people.\"During the 1968 Democratic National Convention, 83 million Americans were glued to their television sets as 10,000 antiwar protesters outside the Chicago Hilton chanted, \"The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!\" over and over as police pushed the crowd off  Chicago's Balbo Drive.3. TV reaches a broader audience\"The TV was the center of the house,\" recalled Tom Hanks, one of the executive producers of CNN's \"The Sixties\" series. \"I don't remember a time without TV.\" Remember, there were only three channels (CBS, NBC and ABC) during the decade, and usually only one TV set per household. There were no \"for mature audiences only\" warnings. The syrupy sitcoms of the 1950s made way for shows such as \"The Dick van Dyke Show\" and \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" These showcased more realistic situations, although there were still the same idealized versions of humanity as the previous decade.Griffith has stated that he put the best parts of himself and the people in his life into the inhabitants of the fictional town of Mayberry to achieve a blend of emotional honesty and laughs. That blueprint served as the benchmark for sitcoms for decades to come. \"Leave It to Beaver,\" which aired from 1957 to 1963,  was the first show shot from the perspective of a child, bringing to life those universal embarrassing moments from childhood that kids were certain they'd never overcome, such as bringing home a bad grade or approaching the object of one's affection.

The advent of the variety showDuring the '60s, there were 18 variety shows going on three networks! It's safe to say that television went \"variety show crazy\" for a while. Sunday night at 8 meant Ed Sullivan; but Dean Martin, Danny Kaye, Danny Thomas and Carol Burnett, to name a few, had eponymous variety-hour programs, too. Beatles + Sullivan = Revolution: Why Beatlemania could never happen todayVariety was considered a man's game at the time, but Burnett broke down a lot of walls with her three-wall sketch show. She and her cast mates sang, danced and did pratfalls -- often breaking character and cracking one another up in the process. Kind of a precursor to SNL's Debbie Downer sketch or most of Jimmy Fallon's SNL sketches.Burnett felt that if she was having fun, her audience would, too.From \"The Sixties: Television Comes of Age\" episode: Carol Burnett's pratfalls5. Television begins to tackle serious issues Through a fantasy/sci-fi lens, \"The Twilight Zone\" creator Rod Serling often told stories of racism and fascism. Similarly, \"Star Trek\" addressed the notion of a time where social evolution has eradicated prejudice and mankind possesses no bias whatsoever. The space age series even featured TV's first interracial kiss, in which Capt. James Kirk tells Lt. Uhura, a black woman, \"Where I come from, size, shape, or color makes no difference.\" What you might not know about the 1964 Civil Rights ActWhen Bill Cosby won the Emmy Award for male lead in \"I Spy\" in 1968, he stated in his acceptance speech, \"We need more people in this industry to ... let it be known to the bigots and the racists that they don't count.\"Incidentally, race was a nonissue in \"I Spy.\" Cosby and actor Robert Culp, who was white, were equals in the series in which they played intelligence officers.BONUS: There actually IS a legit reason why The Flying Nun can \"fly\"The explanation: She weighs 90 pounds and the combination of her cornet and the wind lifts her.

My strongest sense of the '50s comes from Betty Friedan and feminist critiques of the era. And June Cleaver.But the 1950s TV stereotypes of women as housewives in fancy dresses and high heels gave way to a much more interesting cast of characters when the '60s came along.In real life, there probably never was a family as picture perfect and problem free as the '50s Cleavers,  but June Cleaver was certainly the archetype of her decade.  As a child, I didn't quite know what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I knew who I didn't want to be.  I didn't want to be June Cleaver.  The dress. The hair. The pearls.  The sense that she never had any fun, never broke the rules, possibly never even exhaled.  Her entire existence circumscribed by her white picket fence. I couldn't imagine being Donna Reed.  Or the mom from \"Father Knows Best.\"  Or Harriet Nelson.  None of them.  Sally KohnBut then along came Gidget.  I still hadn't been born when the TV show \"Gidget\" premiered in the 1960s.  In fact, my parents had just barely met.  But years later, as a kid in the early 1980s, I would watch reruns of \"Gidget.\"  Finally, a TV woman I wanted to be.  Smart.  Independent.  Even sarcastic at times.  She went to school.  She hung out outside the house.  She even surfed.  She was everything!Video: Name that 60s TV showAs a little girl, I didn't realize all that had happened in the years between June Cleaver and Gidget Lawrence, everything that had changed in society to create a new era of culture that mirrored a new day in America, one in which the compulsion to be June Cleaver was eroded as a universe of Gidgets arose.  Suddenly, women like Marlo Thomas (from \"That Girl\"), independent with careers, were on the scene.  There was Agent 99 from \"Get Smart\" and Emma Peel from \"The Avengers\" --- not just career women, but spies.  Who kicked ass!  There was Samantha in \"Bewitched,\" who had immense powers --- just like Jeannie, about whom I indeed dreamed. And most ground-breaking of all, there was \"Julia,\" which featured a leading African American character who was a single mother. Nick at Night introduced me to the 1960s Technicolor menu of gender roles and role models unheralded in the narrow black-and-white confines of the 1950s.

Elizabeth Montgomery's character Samantha in \"Bewitched\" was always apologizing for using her magic.  Barbara Eden's character in \"I Dream Of Jeannie\" called the man whose house she lived in \"master.\"  And Gidget was always being scolded by her overly stern and moralizing father, who like many male characters in shows of that era, seemed designed as stand-ins for older men of the 1950s generation who were deeply wary of, if not downright resistant to, the equality of women.  At the end of each episode of \"Gidget,\" Sally Field would usually turn to the camera and announce the life lesson she'd learned, usually imparted by her father.  So in a way, metaphorically, she was still bowing to and echoing unquestioned male authority and hegemony.  But it was always Gidget who got the last word, who was the only one who could turn to us and speak to us directly.  She was given that special, powerful voice. And in the next episode, Gidget invariably broke the rules again.  In the socially and politically tumultuous era of the 1960s, the message of \"Gidget\" and \"Bewitched\" and \"I Dream Of Jeannie\" and all these shows where the women kept getting in trouble was not that the rules were enforced by these throwback men, but that the women kept breaking them.  Show after show after show, the women kept breaking the rules, testing the limits, crossing the line.  That was the entire premise, the whole point.  In the new era, there were strong and sassy women who would make their own rules.  And we would watch them and fall in love with them and want to be them and find the rules to break in our own lives and in the world around us.  For women and people of color and gay folks and anyone remotely not Ward Cleaver, the rules of the 1950s were at the very least limiting and in many cases ugly and violent.  These were rules that needed to be broken.  Gidget showed us how.  \"Gidget\" the TV show only lasted for one season, a tragedy from which my little 8-year-old rerun watching self would never fully recover from all those years later.  And yet the social, cultural and political changes that 1960s TV women like Gidget helped both reflect and set in motion --- fortunately, those changes lasted for generations.Related: TV then and now: How does it stack up?Quiz: What is your '60s personality?Photos: 60 iconic moments from the '60sFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

Your '60s family photos, revealedKennedy did not want to attack Cuba, but he was worried about the survival of the human race. He imposed a blockade, and on October 22, 1962, he announced to the world that large, long-range weapons of sudden destruction posed a threat to America. When Russia sent 25 ships toward Cuba, the White House thought it was the early stages of World War III.At the last minute Soviet ships turned around. For the first time, Khrushchev acknowledged the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba, but argued they were merely defensive, and promised to remove them if JFK promised not to invade Cuba. BONUS: Kennedy planned to get out of Vietnam It's impossible to know where we'd be today had Kennedy not gone to Dallas in 1963.Until that year, the President had treated Vietnam as a second-tier issue. He was dealing with Cuba, Berlin and domestic matters. He also felt the people of Vietnam ought to defeat the communists themselves. While the Soviets supported North Vietnam, the United States supported the South. And fears cropped up that if South Vietnam fell, the rest of Southeast Asia was vulnerable, as well as New Zealand and Australia.When the South Vietnam government was overthrown  just weeks before Kennedy's fateful trip to Dallas, he told an aide he would begin to discuss getting out of Vietnam in 1964, after his re-election.Most historians agree that Kennedy would never have done what Lyndon B. Johnson did, which was trust the military implicitly. Kennedy was skeptical of military advice. In his December 17, 1963, address to the U.N. General Assembly, President Johnson told a nation in mourning:\"The United States of America wants to see the Cold War end. We want sanity and security and peace for all. And above all President Kennedy I am sure would regard as his best memorial the fact that in his three years as President the world became a little safer, and the way ahead became a little brighter.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2014", "month": "6", "day": "20"}, "text": {"headline": "us", "text": "Here are five facts about the Vietnam War that may surprise those too young to remember the conflict.", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsThis week's episode of \"The Sixties\" explores the Vietnam WarU.S. involvement escalated in the '60sLBJ: \"A man can fight if he can see daylight ... but there ain't no daylight in Vietnam\"The Vietnam War began in the decade before, but the conflict, and especially U.S. involvement, escalated in the 1960s. For the first time, Americans witnessed the horrors of war, played out on television screens in their living rooms. This week's episode of \"The Sixties\" explores the war and its impact on American culture, then and now. Here are five facts from the episode that may surprise those too young to remember the Vietnam War:1. U.S. involvement in Vietnam began with Eisenhower.In the late 1950s, during the Eisenhower administration, Vietnam had split into North Vietnam, which was communist, and South Vietnam. Cold War anxieties dictated that if the North Vietnamese communists prevailed, the rest of Southeast Asia would fall like dominoes.When he took office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy vowed not to allow South Vietnam fall to communism. 2. The United States and South Vietnam had Catholic presidents who were shot to death in November 1963.JUST WATCHEDThe Sixties: How music shaped a decadeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Sixties: How music shaped a decade 03:02JUST WATCHEDThe Sixties: The War in Vietnam trailerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Sixties: The War in Vietnam trailer 00:29JUST WATCHEDIs Iraq War today's Vietnam?

In addition, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority revolted against their president, Ngo Dinh Diem. They saw the Catholic ruler as a tyrant. The Western-educated Diem, however, wielded absolute power and rose to dictator level by the summer of 1963. The CIA discussed toppling the regime. With U.S. knowledge, Diem was killed by South Vietnamese generals on November 2, 1963. Kennedy immediately regretted Diem's death and U.S. support for the coup.Less than three weeks later, on November 22, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office aboard Air Force One later that day. Soon after, Johnson told a grieving nation, \"John Kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed, that America must move forward.\"3. TV forever changed the way Americans viewed warAs casualties rose, the country increasingly turned against the war. The official line was that Americans were winning in Vietnam, but the evening news told a different story.\"What Vietnam did to America via television was introduce us to a new kind of America,\" said author Lawrence Wright. \"One that was not pure, one that committed the same kinds of atrocities that are always committed in war, but we had never allowed ourselves to see them.\"Reporter Morley Safer recalled the shock of witnessing Marines burn down 150 houses on the outskirts of the village of Cam Ne. An officer told the newsman that he had been ordered to level the area. Three women were wounded in the attack, one baby was killed, and four people were taken prisoner. Safer asked a soldier if he had regrets about leaving people homeless, and the soldier replied, \"You can't expect to do your job and feel pity for these people.\" Another soldier told Safer, \"I think it's sad in a way, but I don't think there's any other way you can get around it in this kind of a war.\"Americans back home were stunned when the CBS report about the Cam Ne village hit the news.After the broadcast, Johnson reportedly called then-CBS president, Frank Stanton, and said, \"Frank, this is your President, your boys just s--t on the flag of the United States.\"4. Some Americans resorted to self-mutilation to avoid the draft.

The youth-oriented \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was one of the final nails in the coffin of the Production Code, or Hays Code, the self-censorship that had ruled American movies for more than 30 years. The industry would soon ditch the strict regulations and adopt ratings that allowed filmmakers more freedom and let parents decide which films their children could see.The decade was ripe for the ratings system, according to Joan Graves, current head of the movie ratings board. \"There was upheaval everywhere.

The climate was right for it,\" Graves says. 5 surprising things that TV in the '60s changedThe major studios and theater owners in 1968 finally agreed to the voluntary rating system, which originally classified movies into four categories. Anyone who has come of age since the '60s has grown up with movie ratings \u2014 initially G, M (later PG), R and X and now G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. Today, they still determine the way in which movies are released and marketed as well as give parents the responsibility for their children's viewing habits. Ratings opened the door to a wider variety of films, says Jon Lewis, a film studies professor at Oregon State University and author of \"Hollywood v. Hardcore: How the Struggle Over Censorship Saved the Modern Film Industry.\"Eventually, the studios came up with \"a new range of products that would have been unthinkable before 1968.\" With \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" Warner, the aging mogul, showed his disdain and lack of interest for what he considered a gangster movie retread with frequent trips to the toilet, according to the Mark Harris book \"Pictures at a Revolution.\" But younger moviegoers discovered something new in this '60s take on '30s outlaws.Both it and \"The Graduate\" appealed to young audiences, precisely what the ratings system intended to help revive the industry, Lewis says.  These two films that captured the decade's rebellious spirit anticipated the new order.\"Their success made it clear to the studios they needed to make a change,\" he says.No 'excessive and lustful kissing' Movies from the Great Society still played by rules from the Great Depression.  The Production Code, ratified in 1930 and strictly enforced by 1934, forbid \"excessive and lustful kissing,\" \"sex perversion,\" \"miscegenation,\" profanity and \"indecent or undue exposure,\" among other things.  Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptions Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThe Beatles arrived in the U.S. 50 years ago and embarked on a history-making path of pop culture dominance. \"The Sixties: The British Invasion\" looks at John, Paul, George and Ringo and how the Fab Four's influence persists. Over the years, the facts of the Beatles' story have sometimes been shoved out of the way by half-truths, misconceptions and outright fiction. Here are a few details you might have heard, with the true story provided by Mark Lewisohn's \"Tune In\" and others. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsJohn Lennon once said that Ringo Starr not only wasn't the best drummer in rock, he wasn't the best drummer in the Beatles. Biographer Mark Lewisohn says this is a line from a TV comedy sketch in the 1980s -- after Lennon died. The Beatles actually defended Ringo strongly over the years.Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThe Beatles were against wearing suits. Again, not true, says Lewisohn. Though Lennon later trashed the neat look as a sellout demanded by manager Brian Epstein, in the early '60s they were eager for a change. \"I just saw it as playing a game,\" said Harrison. \"I'll wear a f****** balloon if somebody's going to pay me!\" said Lennon.Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThey grew up poor. Not really. Harrison's and McCartney's families were working class, and Lennon's childhood included trips to an upscale relative's house in Scotland. Only Starr, who was also sickly, grew up in poverty, in the blighted Dingle neighborhood.Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThey booted drummer Pete Best out of jealousy. Producer George Martin wasn't impressed by Best (second from left), and McCartney has said he \"was holding us back.\" The rest of the Beatles were equally unsentimental. Ringo Starr, who had played with the Beatles occasionally, was a far better drummer -- and when he joined, \"from that moment on, it gelled,\" said Harrison.Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsStu Sutcliffe was a terrible bassist. Though Sutcliffe (standing, third from left) was no McCartney, he went from complete neophyte to solid rhythm player during the band's Hamburg days. He left the job because he wanted to pursue his painting, and McCartney remembers being \"lumbered with\" the position as new bassist.Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsJohn Lennon saw his mother, Julia, killed in front of him. Julia Dykins, as she was known after her marriage to Bobby Dykins, died on July 15, 1958. After a chat with her sister, John's Aunt Mimi, she went to catch a bus and was hit by a car crossing Menlove Avenue. John found out about her death later that day.Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThe Beatles made their U.S. television debut on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" February 9, 1964. It was the band's first U.S. television performance, but they'd already been seen on American TV during a CBS News segment in December, 1963. Pieces from the segment also ran on Jack Paar's talk show in January 1964.Hide Caption 8 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThe title \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" is a reference to LSD. Though its imagery of \"plasticine porters\" and \"kaleidoscope eyes\" owes a lot to drugs (as well as John Lennon's fondness for Lewis Carroll-esque absurdity), the song was inspired by a drawing made by Lennon's son, Julian.Hide Caption 9 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptions\"Paul is dead.\" An elaborate theory -- perhaps best explained by Joel Glazier in a 1979 article for the Beatles fanzine \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" -- maintains that Paul McCartney (here with Brian Epstein) died in 1966 and was replaced by a talented double. (There are dozens of clues for you all -- especially on the White Album.) Though it's fascinating to ponder all the backwards sounds and colorful images, this theory says more about our abilities to find patterns than it does about McCartney's fate.Hide Caption 10 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsThe Beatles performed on Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show.\" Lennon and McCartney did visit \"Tonight\" on May 14, 1968, but they didn't perform -- and the guest host for the evening was Joe Garagiola. Ed McMahon was around, though.Hide Caption 11 of 12 Photos: The Beatles: Myths and misconceptionsYoko Ono broke up the Beatles. Oh, if only Yoko hadn't stolen John away from the group, they would have stayed together! Right. Actually, the Beatles were already fragmenting -- Ringo temporarily left during the making of the White Album, and George walked out during the \"Get Back\" sessions -- and financial issues were getting in the way of the music. Lennon was ready for something new, but everybody was tired.Hide Caption 12 of 12JUST WATCHEDThe British invasion ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe British invasion  00:17 Photos: Photos: Defining moments in '60s TV  Photos: Photos: Defining moments in '60s TV Defining moments in 1960s television \u2013 By 1960, television was firmly entrenched as America's new hearth.

The studios also owned theaters, so they wouldn't show an independent film lacking code approval. But once the studios had to sell off their theaters after a Supreme Court antitrust decision in 1948, they could no longer control what could be shown. TV in 1960s vs. today: Times have changed, right?By the mid-'60s, the American movie industry faced a dilemma: It was losing audiences to television and to foreign films with more realistic views on sex. \"Movies had to compete. (The studios) had to create products that appealed to a much wider audience,\" Lewis says. The crisis over the out-of-date code came to a head in 1966 as Jack Valenti, a special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson and a former advertising and PR exec, took the reins of the Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, a trade group made up of the big studios. \"Within a year into my new duties, I was almost drowned by a river of controversy I had not anticipated that tested me as nothing before or since,\" Valenti wrote in his memoir, \"This Time, This Place: My Life in War, the White House, and Hollywood.\" Before his arrival, \"The Pawnbroker\" became the first code-approved movie with nude scenes. In the Sidney Lumet film, a Nazi concentration camp survivor (Rod Steiger) recalls the horrors of his wife being stripped naked in the camp in a flashback while a desperate prostitute exposes her breasts to him. On appeal, \"The Pawnbroker\" received an exemption to the code as \"a special and unique\" case that shouldn't be viewed as \"setting a precedent.\" The unraveling had begun.'Blow-Up' over censorship Valenti first had to tackle what he would later call the Fort Sumter in the war over censorship -- \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"JUST WATCHEDThe assassination of JFKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe assassination of JFK 00:29JUST WATCHEDSixties: Back-to-back episodes trailerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSixties: Back-to-back episodes trailer 00:10JUST WATCHEDHow music shaped a decadeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow music shaped a decade 03:02JUST WATCHEDAre these songs British or American?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAre these songs British or American? 01:37The adaptation of the Edward Albee play was full of profanity that had never been heard before in an American movie, including \"screw you\" and \"hump the hostess.\" In this bruising drama, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton square off as a middle-aged academic couple who invite a young professor and his wife over for an evening of \"fun and games.\"  Director Mike Nichols didn't film any cover shots with less salty language, so the movie would be difficult to tone down. Valenti negotiated with Jack Warner for three hours. \"At the end of the meeting, Jack and I had agreed that we would leave in 'hump the hostess' but take out three instances of 'screw you' and leave one intact,\" Valenti recalled in his memoir. \"Afterward, I told (MPAA general counsel Louis) Nizer I was thoroughly uncomfortable with the meeting. It seemed silly, even absurd, that grown men could be spending their time on such a puerile discussion.\" Besides watering down language, Warner Bros. agreed the movie would carry a warning that no one under 18 would be admitted without an adult, a precursor to the R rating. But Valenti recognized that \"throwing the Hays Code over the side and replacing it with the warning 'For Mature Audiences' was not going to cut it. It was too little and very late.\" MGM soon bypassed the code entirely with \"Blow-Up,\" distributed through a subsidiary. Michelangelo Antonioni's film about \"swinging\" London flouted the censors with nudity, sex and drug use, including a photographer's romp with two nude teen girls. Premier Productions was established for \"Blow-Up's\" release; code restrictions didn't apply since it wasn't an MPAA member like MGM.  \"It sent a message that the studios were so fed up they were willing to set up a make-believe subsidiary,\" says Lewis, the Oregon State professor. By that time, \"the studios are not on board anymore.\" Ratings system takes shape Fearing the possibility of government action, Valenti became determined to scuttle the code. His solution was a classification plan, geared toward parents, that the studios had resisted because they thought it would limit audiences.\"The idea was to set up a voluntary movie ratings system, giving advance cautionary information to parents so they could make better decisions about the movies their children went to see,\" Valenti wrote in his memoir.It took Valenti two years to sell the concept, first to industry groups and then to religious organizations, according to Graves, chairwoman of the ratings board, the Classification and Rating Administration. Its success was guaranteed when the National Association of Theatre Owners agreed to enforce the ratings, she says. \"That convinced people that it would have teeth.\" \"They are the first line of defense,\" Graves says. \"They not only prefer rated films but enforce (them).\"The system went into effect November 1, 1968. Filmmakers could appeal to an industry panel if they objected to the board's decisions. Critics over the years have contended ratings are arbitrary and tend to be more lenient on violence and tougher on sex and language.But Valenti always defended his baby.\"It has lived a long, full, useful, and sometimes controversial life,\" he wrote in his memoir, published shortly after his 2007 death. \"... Nothing lasts very long in this brutal, explosive, unpredictable marketplace unless it is conferring some benefit on the people it aims to serve -- in this instance, the parents of America.\"The ratings system is not perfect, says Matthew Bernstein, chairman of Emory University's Department of Film and Media Studies, arguing it can have the effect of censorship if filmmakers have to make cuts for a certain rating. But he says it's important to note the difference between such a system and the old code. \"Classification is different from censorship by its nature. It's one thing to say you can't see a film at all,\" says Bernstein, also editor of \"Controlling Hollywood: Censorship and Regulation in the Studio Era.\" Different kinds of movies for a new HollywoodWith the code gone, the decade's end saw a flood of adult-oriented films. The themes of violence, sex and outsiderness that \"Bonnie and Clyde\" explored were prevalent in 1969, the first full year of ratings.In \"Midnight Cowboy,\" a Texan (Jon Voight) dreams of becoming a hustler in New York and servicing rich women. But he ends up working 42nd Street. Impoverished, he has only one friend, an ill con man (Dustin Hoffman).\"It's a film about -- not a gay prostitute -- but he engages in gay sex acts for money,\" says Lewis, the Oregon State professor. \"I can't even imagine suggesting that pre-1968.\"Four years after \"The Sound of Music\" captured the top Oscar, \"Midnight Cowboy\" became the first X-rated movie to win best picture, although it was later rated R. (Initially, X didn't carry such a stigma, but it became associated with porn films after the MPAA didn't copyright it. NC-17 replaced X in 1990.)\"The Wild Bunch\" has minimal sex but lots of violence. Whereas \"Bonnie and Clyde\" faced ambush in a quick, shocking hail of bullets, this R-rated Western comes with bookends of gory shootouts that seem to last forever. Outlaws ride into a Texas border town posing as soldiers to rob a railroad office and square off against bounty hunters in a ferocious gunbattle.\"Ten years earlier it would have been a climactic scene in a movie,\" Bernstein says. \"This film begins with it and escalates further in the final shootout with machine guns.\"There, the outlaws get slaughtered in Mexico. \"It challenges who's the good guy and who's not. You can't really say,\" Lewis says.The violence continues in \"Easy Rider,\" a time capsule of late '60s counterculture. Rednecks fire away at hippies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) on a motorcycle trek in the South. A bike explodes into a ball of fire, evoking images of Vietnam.It's open to debate whether the industry was responding to the marketplace with these movies or reacting to changes after years of assassinations, protests and war.The rating system wasn't motivated by social transformation, but by money, Lewis contends. \"It's wrong to think of the new ratings as going hand in hand with the Age of Aquarius,\" he says, adding that \"it was a necessary business move. Within four or five years, Hollywood turned around, and it hasn't had a bad year since.\" But these movies weren't made in a vacuum.\"The studios wouldn't have made these if they hadn't determined that's where the audience was,\" Bernstein says. \"Business informs these decisions. But they also happen in a social context.\"Were ratings a marketing ploy? A response to a demand for greater freedom? Some of both? The answer may be as ambiguous as the movies that signed off that crazy, wild decade that still fascinates and confuses us.5 things to know about BeatlemaniaGene Seymour: The best summer movie everShould smoking trigger an R rating?

It worked out just fine.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)If a film drops at Sundance and no one is there to see it, does it still make a sound?  After a last-minute change of plans brought on by soaring Covid-19 cases, Sundance made the decision to shutter its physical event in the mountains of Utah and make for the online hills. The infrastructure was already in place from last year and 2022 was supposed to be a hybrid event in any case, with some journalists and viewers logging in from afar.The answer to that initial question, it seems, is yes. The online pivot has resulted in a growth in Sundance's reach and money followed. Apple TV+ paid a reported $15 million for Cooper Raiff's coming of age comedy \"Cha Cha Real Smooth,\" while Sony Picture Classics bought Oliver Hermanus' \"Living\" (a remake of Akira Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\") for around $5 million and Searchlight spent $7.5 million on the Emma Thompson-fronted sex-positive chamber piece \"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.\" On the documentary side, National Geographic cleaned up, buying \"The Territory,\" a profile of indigenous conservationists in the Brazilian Amazon, along with festival smash-hit \"Fire of Love,\" about married volcanologists, while Netflix swooped in on \"Descendant,\" Margaret Brown's moving account of the search for the last slave ship to reach US shores by the descendants of those who were on board.None of these films were awarded grand prizes from Sundance juries, however. \"Nanny,\" Nikyatu Jusu's phantasmagoric tale of an undocumented Senegalese migrant in New York, won in the US Dramatic category, while \"Utama,\" Alejandro Loayza Grisi's sparse and beautiful Bolivian eco-parable, won World Dramatic. The US Documentary award went to Ben Klein and Violet Columbus for \"The Exiles,\" which follows the lives of exiled dissidents and a filmmaker reviving an a project with them, and Shaunak Sen won the World equivalent for \"All That Breathes,\" a profile of two brothers trying to protect local wildlife amid Delhi's air pollution crisis. The Festival Favourite Award, selected by public vote, went to \"Navalny,\" Daniel Roher's docuthriller about Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny (CNN and HBO Max are distributing).A look at some of the noteworthy Sundance Film Festival titles follows below.Read More\"You Won't Be Alone\"Noomi Rapace in Goran Stolevski's \"You Won't Be Alone.\"Goran Stolevski's dazzling fable about a body-swapping witch in 19th century Macedonia has much to recommend it. The writer-director's accomplished debut feature transports us into an agrarian past of calloused tradition and deep-set suspicion, not all which are unfounded. Baby Nevena has been abducted by an evil spirit and raised away from the village. At 16 she becomes a witch and makes contact with the nearby community, only to accidentally kill a woman (Noomi Rapace, \"Lamb,\" \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"). Nevena then assumes her identity; it won't be her last.The screenplay uses the bones of folk horror to explore patriarchal structures, family and sacrifice, employing this ultimate outsider as a curious mirror to society. The film benefits from beautiful work by cinematographer Matthew Chuang, who captures the idyllic countryside with a sense of wonderment and dread, while an ethereal voiceover threads together the thoughts of this young woman in various guises, striving to find meaning and connection.  The film was picked up by Focus Features ahead of the festival and will be released in the US in April. \"Cha Cha Real Smooth\"Cooper Raiff and Dakota Johson in \"Cha Cha Real Smooth.\"Cooper Raiff's second feature is further evidence that one of the smartest things you can do for your movie right now is cast Dakota Johnson in it. Raiff, writing, directing and starring as listless 22-year-old Andrew, enters the orbit of Domino (Johnson). Andrew's little brother is in class with Domino's daughter Lola (Vanessa Burghardt) and both find themselves on the bar and bat mitzvah circuit (Andrew first as a chaperone then a professional party coordinator). There's more than a frisson between the two, but she's engaged, though her fianc\u00e9 is mostly absent. Johnson brings an air of mystery to every performance, and Raiff harnesses that intractability. Domino seems sad and wise, Andrew sweet and puppy-doggish. What does Domino really want? If Andrew stopped projecting on to her, maybe he'd find out.Raiff's smart script pokes holes in both rom-coms and coming-of-age narratives, and dares to suggest that life may not be figured out in line with society's milestones. A bar mitzvah or degree does not a grown-up make. Nor does time always provide emotional intelligence. Snark and self-conscious laughs cede the floor to something satisfyingly earnest, with Johnson on hand to offer some much-needed counsel.\"Emergency\"RJ Cyler, Sebastian Chacon and Donald Elise Watkins \"Emergency\" by Carey Williams.Students Kunle (Donald Elise Watkins), Sean (RJ Cyler) and Carlos (Sebastian Chacon) are kicking off the night to end all nights, but hit a bump when they discover an intoxicated girl on their living room floor. So far so normal for this entry to the \"one-last-wild-night-out\" canon. Where it goes is anything but. Director Carey Williams and writer KD Davila offer a welcome corrective to the subgenre. The reality is that prevailing narratives -- from \"Booksmart\" and \"Superbad\" back to \"American Graffiti\" by way of \"Dazed and Confused\" -- have been dominated by White faces. How authorities react to the characters' hijinks and farcical misunderstandings in those films is inseparable from their racial profile. As Sean points out, the same latitude would not be afforded to two Black men and a Latino trying to help a White woman. \"Anybody who's darker than a brown paper bag should get the f--- out of here,\" he says at one point. Williams and Davila deliver a subversive blow to a cosy formula. The film is abrasive in driving home its point, and by the end is a jangling bag of raw nerve endings that feels thoroughly warranted (kudos to Watkins who provides the emotional clout). As an example of how prejudice imprints itself on the next generation it's effective, but as a deconstruction of the subgenre, even more so.   \"Living\"Bill Nighy in Oliver Hermanus' \"Living.\"It's a bold idea to remake a movie by Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, although it helps to have Nobel Prize-winner Kazuo Ishiguro on screenplay duties and a star of Bill Nighy's calibre on board. Let's not take credit away from director Oliver Hermanus (\"Moffie\") however, who delivers this reworking of Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\" (1952) with real elegance. The story moves from Japan to post-war Britain, but the stiff suits and crippling bureaucracy remains the same. Nighy is Mr Williams, a dreadfully repressed widow who's made an art of passing the buck as a middle manager at London's council. When he receives a terminal diagnosis, Williams goes through a Scrooge-ian epiphany, with co-worker Margaret (Aimee Lou Wood) and a bohemian Tom Burke helping him get there. Williams' mindset -- that the worst thing you could possibly do to someone is bother them with your feelings -- speaks to one of the most destructive aspects of polite society. If that doesn't chime with you, then mileage may vary. However, for those who can handle the buttoned-up atmosphere, there's rich rewards in Nighy's delicate character study. As a gentleman who never learned how to live, it's deeply moving watching him take tentative steps with one eye on his impending doom. The veteran thesp has never been better.\"Utama\" (\"Our Home\")A still from Alejandro Loayza Grisi's \"Utama.\"First-time director Alejandro Loayza Grisi heads for the Bolivian highlands in this quiet, well-crafted drama about an elderly Quechua couple faced with a life-threatening drought.Real-life couple Jos\u00e9 Calcina and Luisa Quispe play Virginio and Sisa, llama farmers living on parched flats that haven't seen rain for a year. The old, dwindling community pray, give offerings and hope. The other option, their visiting grandson Clever floats, is to up sticks and move to the city. Giving up a way of life in life's twilight is not an easy decision, however.A slight plot gives room for faces and places to breath. First-time actors Calcina and Quispe deliver the kind of stoic, affectless performances that are a boon for a director. Both seem capable of writing whole chapters in a single look -- particularly Calcina as Virginio, whose fate seems tied to the land. The film looks great too, shot by Barbara Alvarez to maximize the grand sun-bleached vistas.\"Time has gotten tired,\" we're told. An eco-parable of stark beauty, Grisi's film is a haunting, hypnotic experience.\"Fire of Love\"A still from \"Fire of Love\" by Sara Dosa.Katia and Maurice Krafft put the \"rock\" in rockstar scientists in Sara Dosa's brilliant documentary destined to burnish their legend. Her account of the late French volcanologists is witty, heart-warming and enthusiastically curious, much like the subjects themselves. Admittedly, the Kraffts are calling many of the shots -- literally -- as Dosa draws on found footage taken by the married couple between the 1960s and 1990s as they zigzagged the globe in pursuit of scientific knowledge. But what footage it is: just watching is enough to make you want to don one of their silvery protective suits.The Kraffts were no stranger to the spotlight, evidenced by clips from talk show interviews and news reports. These scientists had a public persona, and Maurice particularly knew how to leverage their fame to finance their derring-do (and how their derring-do bolstered their fame). Paddling into the middle of a sulfuric acid lake in a rubber dingy may have scientific merit, but it also makes for a thrilling story.Not that the couple -- and by extension the film -- is ever insincere about their vocation. We feel their devastation when thousands are killed by Mount Ruiz, Colombia in 1985, and feel for the couple, picking through the aftermath of Mount Saint Helens' monstrous eruption in 1980. \"It will kill me one day,\" Maurice says of his relationship with his work. We know that a volcano will claim them both, as Miranda July's voiceover explains to us at the start of the film. This knowledge frames everything that follows. However, rather than paint them as reckless or spike the film with a dose of fatalism, Dosa's portrait of a marriage -- to each other and to volcanoes -- remains earnest and full of admiration. \"Emily the Criminal\"Aubrey Plaza in \"Emily the Criminal.\"Any film that allows Aubrey Plaza to unload like this is a worthy endeavor, and writer-director John Patton Ford gives the actor a lot to tear into as a debt-laden graduate digging herself out of a hole. The titular Emily has fallen behind her peers. Earning crumbs in Los Angeles' gig economy, a co-worker puts her in touch with a quick money \"dummy shopper\" operation involving cloned credit cards and soon-to-be black-market goods. It's a ballsy scam and a good showcase for Emily's chops. She's wants more of a taste, linking up with Theo Rossi's Youcef for more lucrative -- and more risky -- jobs. Ford's film is a true thriller, built around a series of stressful set pieces and little let up in between. Comparisons to the Safdie brothers' \"Good Time\" and \"Uncut Gems\" are inevitable, but Ford's film contains a stronger moral backbone. Emily wants to live straight, but a criminal record (for reasons best left unsaid) is a career obstacle. When interviewing for a long-term internship, she rightly calls out the employer when it becomes clear it's unpaid. The labor market is broken, and exploitative practices on both sides of the law aren't all that different. Plaza is given a great showcase for her brand of weary righteousness, pouring scorn where she sees fit. Emily is far from perfect, but we're always sympathetic toward her and her get-money crusade. That's star power for you.  \"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande\"Emma Thompson and Daryl McCormack in Sophie Hyde's \"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande.\"Breathless headlines will tell you Emma Thompson bares all in this sex-positive drama from Sophie Hyde. That may be true, but they only prove the point made by screenwriter Katy Brand: that women past a certain age are expected to retreat from their bodies and bodily pleasure, rather than find cause for celebration.Escort Leo (Daryl McCormack) is here to help widowed teacher Nancy (Thompson) do just that. Brand builds a trim screenplay around three meetings in a bland hotel room. If the space is lacking imagination, it's only a reflection of Nancy's vanilla love life to date. She's on the other side of 31 years of marriage and has never had an orgasm; achingly self-conscious and wracked by feelings of hypocrisy and inadequacy, but also proud and prickly. Leo couldn't be nicer (or is that professional?), and over the course of the movie is out to prove that sexual healing isn't limited to the act itself.Hyde's chamber piece could easily be a stage play with its limited setting and tight focus on two actors circling one another. The ever-great Thompson finds an equal sparring partner in McCormack, whose break-out turn is sure to attract plenty of attention. Tender, smart and uplifting, it's already starting conversations.\"Lucy and Desi\"A still from \"Lucy and Desi,\" directed by Amy Poehler.Amy Poehler's documentary about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz looks at the famous couple's professional and personal relationship.Poehler takes the talking heads route, with Bette Midler, Norman Lear, Carol Burnett and others weighing in. However, her most insightful interviewee is Ball and Arnaz's daughter Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill, who offers an intimate view of their marriage and its aftermath. More than anyone, she ties the whole story together. Archival footage and home audio tapes are on hand to illustrate the couple's rough ride to fame, their many achievements and the ways they changed the industry, from how sitcom \"I Love Lucy\" introducing the re-run model to the other iconic shows incubated by their company Desilu Productions.

There's the thumbing of the program and picking out titles, making priorities and curating your own double, triple, quadruple bills. There's the hopping between venues, meeting faces old and new, emerging from dark rooms disappointed or elated or somewhere in between. For press, there's a lot of work (I promise) concealed between start and finish too. But the shape of your festival is usually dictated by you. That wasn't the case for some covering the Toronto International Film Festival this year, where a hybrid physical-virtual festival and a dose of bureaucracy fractured one festival into many, depending on where you were in the world. For those in Toronto, life was rosy. The virtual component was rather more trying. After rolling with the punches last year and hosting a successful, largely virtual festival, similar access was expected in 2021, with international press pointed to the digital viewing portal that had served everyone so well in 2020. Only this time around film after film was held back, either playing in cinemas only or restricted to certain countries. What was available where seemed to change daily in the lead up to opening night. In one territory your cup runneth over, in another you were left parched. Plenty of hustling was required to see films by other means.One can't blame the festival for everything; these decisions are in the hands of studios and distributors. For some titles like \"Dune,\" with a mammoth release on the horizon, it made sense to play it in theaters only. For smaller arthouse films or those with limited distribution, the logic seems harder to justify. Festivals are exactly the place where these films are able to burst onto the scene. Limiting their audience and the buzz generated feels self-defeating. Read MoreYet there was still a lot to love in the slimmed down lineup this year. The festival's People's Choice Award, in recent years an Oscars bellwether, went to \"Belfast,\" Kenneth Branagh's coming of age drama set in North Ireland during the Troubles. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's \"The Rescue,\" about the miraculous 2018 Thai cave rescue, walked away with the same prize in the documentary category. But for awards season prognosticators, the picture out of Toronto was perhaps murkier than in previous years.As a film festival that entered the multiverse, where what you saw was dictated by IP address as much as taste, it's hard to sum up TIFF. This writer is the first to admit he has blind spots -- blind spots he'd rather not have, but simply couldn't be filled. Nevertheless, let's try. With a towering asterisk attached, here's what we enjoyed at Toronto.\"The Power of the Dog\" Benedict Cumberbatch as rancher Phil Burbank in \"The Power of the Dog.\"Jane Campion doesn't release films often, but when she does people pay attention. With good reason -- her adaptation of John Savage's novel, a Western set in 1920s Montana but filmed in Campion's native New Zealand, is prestige cinema of the highest order. Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons are rancher brothers Phil and George Burbank, joined by blood and precious little else. But their uneasy codependency is interrupted when the urbane George marries young widow Rose (Kirsten Dunst), much to the chagrin of rough-hewn Phil, who launches psychological warfare against the \"cheap schemer\" and her gentle son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) once they move to the homestead. Cumberbatch, all sinuous guile and calculated cruelty, haunts their footsteps like Mrs. Danvers in a 10-gallon hat. Galoup, the imperious drill sergeant played by Denis Lavant in Claire Denis' \"Beau Travail,\" also springs to mind. However, the brand of calloused machismo Phil projects doesn't land as wholly authentic. Why is he trying so hard? And what caused him to curdle inside? Over time and a series of menacing interactions with Peter, cracks in the facade are pried open until they become the film's chief concern.    Taut and as well engineered as the rope Phil weaves with dedicated fervor, Campion's film is one of great restraint. Ari Wegner's compositions of New Zealand's Otago peninsula are to die for, but rather than let the film become swallowed by the epic setting, her eye for expression and gesture allow us to feel every beat of the characters' journeys. Another corking score from Jonny Greenwood is used sparingly; just enough to harmonize with the moment, but never so much as to try to dictate how we feel. Campion trusts the craftsmanship in front and behind the camera to tell a story without needing to dig the spurs in. For that and much else besides, more power to her.\"Dune\"Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica Atreides in \"Dune.\"The road to \"Dune\" is long and fraught with peril. Just ask Alejandro Jodorowsky and David Lynch, with one aborted film and one critically-panned between them. Both failed in their separate ways. Was it hubris that made Denis Villeneuve believe he could crack the \"unfilmable\" tome by Frank Herbert? In any case, he's succeeded in finally doing justice to the book -- the first half of it, at least. This is a cavernous cathedral of a film, full of spectacle and awful beauty. The scale of it all, from vast landscapes to monolithic buildings, is huge, the battles epic, the Hans Zimmer score thundering and sonorous, all designed to have audiences cowering in the pews. It's Sturm und Drang sci-fi by way of the Old Testament -- fitting for a film centered on a messianic figure. That would be Paul (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), heir of House Atreides, who travels with his parents (Oscar Isaac and Rebecca Ferguson) and entourage to the planet Arrakis, where they have been commanded by the Emperor to take over its valuable spice mining operation. Previous colonizers the Harkonnen are none too pleased, nor the Fremen, natives of Arrakis. Much politicking and violence ensues, along with a heavy dose of mysticism and premonition courtesy of Paul and his mother, a member of an intergalactic society of witches called the Bene Gesserit.As you might have guessed, the film is plot-heavy, and Villeneuve is forced to abandon the old maxim \"show don't tell.\" We're told a lot, often more than once, and the script occasionally strays toward coddling the audience. Exposition rather than fear may be the mind killer. But one can't knock the film's ambition: a serious blockbuster that makes for an overwhelming experience, precision-made for the big screen. \"Mothering Sunday\" Odessa Young and Josh O'Connor in Eva Husson's \"Mothering Sunday.\"French director Eva Husson has made one of the most maddeningly, intoxicatingly British films of the year in \"Mothering Sunday,\" an adaptation of Graham Swift's novel about love, loss and the straitjacket of propriety in upper class England.Three families have been ravaged by the First World War, with only one son, Paul, returning from battle between them. Played by an insouciant Josh O'Connor, he's unhappily engaged and having an affair with Jane (a luminous Odessa Young), the maid of family friends the Nivens (Colin Firth and Olivia Colman). On Mothering Sunday, the two lovers wriggle from under the feet of their respective families and meet for a long, languid day away from prying eyes and society's expectations. If only life were so simple.Husson frames the story via Jane's recollections as an older woman, now a successful writer. It's not the only point of comparison with Joe Wright's \"Atonement,\" but whereas that Ian McEwan adaptation went for maximum emotional wallop, here events are largely underplayed. We watch a generation trying to hold back a tidal wave of grief with starched collars and cucumber sandwiches, retreating into nostalgia and routine. Of course, it cannot, and when emotion does surface it breaches like a hernia. Colman and Firth both get their time to shine. In fact, there's fine performances all round, and sumptuous camerawork from Jamie D. Ramsay casts everything in a hopelessly romantic light. But it's the smouldering duo of O'Connor and Young who set the screen ablaze as the young lovers grasping for a future of their own, however unlikely it may be.   \"Attica\" \"Attica\" by Stanley Nelson.The US has no shortage of shameful chapters in its history, and Stanley Nelson's documentary pulls out a particularly egregious one in his retelling of the Attica prison riot in New York state, 1971. Nelson kicks off with the initial uprising in the prison courtyard, before doubling back to provide context. Correctional officers from the local town of Attica were White and worlds apart from the majority Black inmates at a facility known as \"the last stop.\" Degrading treatment is detailed by former inmates, who looked for but were denied humane conditions. \"It was a timebomb ready to blow,\" says the daughter of one of the guards. Blow it did, but former inmates describe the opposite of chaos in the fall out: erecting tents, building latrines, establishing a medical station and voting on leadership. One inmate wistfully recalls looking up at the stars and falling asleep without hearing the clang of metal bars locking. But the only thing that allowed this state of empowerment were the guards inmates had held hostage (an irony and story element the film does not engage with as much as it might).The \"naked fist of power,\" as one voice describes it, was ready to show its hand. The intervention of state police and correctional officers is shown via harrowing surveillance footage and graphic photography, showing the deadly assault and brutal reprisals -- a savage reassertion of authority and the status quo. A furious, blistering film, Nelson's combination of testimony and searing visuals is potent, and has no qualms pointing the finger of blame. As one interviewee laments, \"It didn't have to be this way.\"\"Sundown\"Tim Roth as a tourist on a bad trip in Michel Franco's \"Sundown.\"Tim Roth saw how Michel Franco depicted prison in \"New Order\" and said, \"sign me up!\" The Mexican provocateur behind last year's incendiary revolutionary drama is back with another bleak tale, albeit on a smaller scale and with a lower body count.Neil (Roth) and Alice (Charlotte Gainsbourg) are wealthy Brits on holiday in Acapulco with her children Colin and Alexa when an emergency forces them to return home. Everyone does except Neil, whose passport has gone missing. He's forced to hang out in Acapulco in holiday overtime, as the city begins to show its ugly side and so does he.Only it turns out he didn't lose his passport after all. There's a sense of unraveling, an abdication of responsibility at play. He's abandoning himself, his relationships become fraught, without us really understanding why. But perhaps we're looking for answers in the wrong places. Like the director's previous works, these characters are playthings for Franco -- a new set of pawns to explore contemporary Mexico. His Acapulco has a thing for casual violence, a huge wealth disparity, and a side order of grubbiness alongside the tourist traps. These observations only find the center of the frame in snatches, but it's always there. That, rather than the crises of wealthy tourists, is what Franco believes to be the true tragedy, one suspects.\"Petite Maman\"Sisters Jos\u00e9phine and Gabrielle Sanz in \"Petite Maman.\"Celine Sciamma's follow up to critical hit \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" sees the director swap rugged coastlines and period setting for a small-scale fable that nevertheless delivers big.We follow eight-year-old Nelly as she travels to her mother's childhood home. Her grandmother has recently died, and her parents have the task of clearing it out. Left to her own devices, Nelly heads into the woods only to discover Marion, her doppelganger, who inexplicably may also be her mother.Shot during the pandemic, Sciamma (once again directing her own screenplay) interweaves three generations, compressing and stretching time, allowing her characters to gain a deeper empathy for one another. Sisters Jos\u00e9phine and Gabrielle Sanz as Nelly and the young Marion carry the picture, finding wisdom in their performances that belies their years. \"Secrets aren't always something we try to hide. Sometimes we just have no one to tell,\" one says to the other, and you believe every word. It's a lovely film, understated and deeply felt, and told with great economy.\"The Rescue\" \"The Rescue,\" directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin.Part of the thrill of \"Free Solo,\" Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin's Oscar-winning documentary about Alex Honnold's terrifying ascent of El Capitan, was that we knew the outcome. It meant we could sit back and enjoy the peril. Similarly, the rescue of the Wild Boars soccer team from a Thai cave in 2018 made headlines around the world. Watching an account of the fraught mission to free the boys and their coach from a flooded cave network in northern Thailand therefore comes with its own safety net: however bad it gets, we know it'll be ok in the end.That doesn't make Vasarhelyi and Chin's documentary any less tense. Through some helpful graphics and a good spread of talking heads we're walked through the rescue efforts, which would eventually involve some 5,000 people, including Thai Navy SEALs, the US military and an international cohort of specialists and volunteers. But it's the role of a group of amateur cave divers -- call them the Avengers of middle-aged hobbyists -- that is given prominence. Rightly so. Without Britons Rick Stanton and Jon Volanthen, and later Chris Jewell, Jason Mallinson and Australian doctor Richard Harris, among others, the situation might have turned to tragedy. They were able to find the boys, and would eventually take them out under heavy sedation (the details of which were not fully-disclosed at the time).Some sharp questioning reveals these divers have much in common -- they're insular, single-minded, shy. But without them this huge team effort wouldn't have happened. They made the impossible possible, and it's clear the experience changed them. Vasarhelyi and Chin's film is a fitting tribute to them and a huge crowd-pleaser to boot.\"Dug Dug\" A still from \"Dug Dug,\" written and directed by Ritwik Pareek.In a desiccated corner of India, out of focus fairy lights meld into a great wash of blue and purple. Tottering in focus and yet definitely out of it is hopeless drunk Thakur, about to hop on his motorbike for what will be his last ride. The bike, on the other hand, has a long and exhilarating journey ahead of it.You see, Thakur's bike just won't be tamed. Locked up after the unfortunate demise of its owner, the bike disappears from police custody and returns to the crash scene so many times the community believes it's a sign that Thakur has become a god. When the bike starts answering their prayers things really take off.Fans of Quentin Dupieux's anthropomorphic tire slasher \"Rubber\" know how much fun can be had in this absurd space. In this case, writer-director Ritwik Pareek turns his two-wheeled agent of chaos into a vehicle for satirizing religion, in particular the systems and structures that swoop in upon realizing there's a buck to be made.\"Dug Dug\" is not a subtle film, full of bright colors, flashy cinematography and smash cuts (Pareek has cited Edgar Wright as an influence and it shows). Then again, its broad satire wouldn't be well served by telling its story in half measures. We're swept up in the razzmatazz and showmanship, making believers of us all.

Based on the Baker Street Irregulars, who appeared in three of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, the titular characters are a gang of scrappy street kids, led by a 17-year-old girl called Bea, who eke out a living in London's grimy underbelly. Watson -- an uncharacteristically sinister figure -- recruits the teens on behalf of his mysterious \"business partner\" Holmes, who is holed up at the duo's traditional base at 221b Baker Street.But tradition stops there: the teen sleuths are not cracking ordinary criminal cases. Instead, they must battle the dark, supernatural forces at work in creator Tom Bidwell's horror-infused reimagining of Victorian London. Rather than make a classic adaptation, \"we wanted to do something very different,\" says Bidwell. Bidwell says his inspiration came from Arthur Conan Doyle. Although best-known as the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Conan Doyle had a strong interest in spiritualism, fairies, mediums and other phenomena, and was a \"terrific\" ghost story writer, says Bidwell, adding that his series is \"an ode\" to the author.The Irregulars hard at work, solving a crime.Read More\"The Irregulars\" is testament to how far interpretations of Holmes have evolved since Conan Doyle first introduced the pipe-smoking detective in his 1887 novel \"A Study in Scarlet.\" Since then, Holmes has appeared in over 250 film and TV adaptations -- more than any other literary human character, and been played by actors including Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, each putting their own spin on the crime-solving super-sleuth.Other adaptations have gone further and reimagined the entire story so that, as with \"The Irregulars,\" Holmes is not the star of the show and other characters take center stage. Here are five Sherlock Holmes adaptations worth watching:\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\"Following a successful career playing Shakespearean roles and appearing on Broadway, English actor Basil Rathbone debuted as Sherlock Holmes in the 1939 film \"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\" Rathbone's Holmes was elegant, smart and relentless in pursuit of the truth, and for many fans he perfectly embodied Conan Doyle's literary character. The actor continued in the role for another 13 movies, and also played Holmes in radio plays, before laying down his deerstalker hat and pipe for good.  For many fans, Basil Rathbone was the quintessential Sherlock Holmes. \"Sherlock\"Set in present-day London, the BBC's award-winning series \"Sherlock\" ran from 2010 until 2017. Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes describes himself as a \"high-functioning sociopath\" in the first episode, and the actor skillfully captured the detective's signature mix of cerebral brilliance and emotional detachment, while sparring with Martin Freeman, playing a grounded, dependable version of Dr. Watson. Benedict Cumberbatch (in the hat) and Martin Freeman at the Baker Street HQ. \"Elementary\"Set in modern-day Manhattan this TV series, which ran from 2012 until 2019, starred Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes, with Lucy Liu playing Joan Watson. Lee Miller's Holmes is a recovering alcoholic, striving to maintain his sobriety under Watson's watchful eye. Watson wasn't the only character to be re-cast as a woman: Natalie Dormer played the part of Holmes's nemesis, criminal mastermind Jamie Moriarty. Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) and Watson (Lucy Liu) looking for clues.  \"Miss Sherlock\"In this 2018 barrier-breaking, female-led adaptation set in modern-day Tokyo, Holmes is incarnated as consultant detective Sara Shelly Futaba, played by the late Yuko Takeuchi. With her extraordinary observation and deductive skills, Futaba solves a series of mysteries with the help of a Watson-like character, a gifted surgeon called Wato Tachibana, played by Shihori Kanjiya. The actors swapped the classic pipe prop for a more fragrant rose.Yuko Takeuchi (center) in \"Miss Sherlock.\" \"Enola Holmes\"Sherlock retreated to a supporting role in Netflix's hit 2020 movie \"Enola Holmes\" while Millie Bobby Brown stole the limelight as the detective's sparky younger sister, in an adaptation of the first of Nancy Springer's series of young adult fiction books, \"The Enola Holmes Mysteries.\" The Conan Doyle estate filed a lawsuit against Netflix claiming that its version of Sherlock Holmes, played by actor Henry Cavill as being kind and emotional, violated the author's copyright. The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2020. Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) learning life skills.

But his latest film is about all of us.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)Kevin Macdonald has carved a career out of telling the stories of extraordinary people, and ordinary people finding themselves in extraordinary situations. The Oscar-winning director behind \"Touching the Void,\" \"Whitney\" and upcoming drama \"The Mauritanian\" does not do dull. So, on paper at least, making a documentary out of thousands of hours of people's home videos reads like a shift into a lower gear. That said, we live in interesting times.In \"Life in a Day 2020,\" Macdonald takes on the monumental task of summarizing what the world was up to on July 25, 2020. Two unfolding events dominated the news cycle, as Black Lives Matters protests gripped the United States and a world in lockdown recorded 254,000 coronavirus cases. But those headlines are only a fraction of the story -- which is precisely the point of the film.To craft a fuller picture, Macdonald and executive producer Ridley Scott asked the public to submit their own footage from July 25, just as they had done for the original \"Life in a Day\" in 2010, a feature cut together from 4,500 hours of home videos sent in from around the world. \"I plagiarized the idea from Humphrey Jennings, the great British documentary maker,\" Macdonald tells CNN. Jennings' 1942 film \"Listen to Britain\" recorded the lives of the public during World War II, telling their stories in their own words. At a time of great privation and upheaval, both the existential and the trivial emerge. Jennings teased out the personal from what could otherwise have been a sweeping metanarrative of Britain in wartime. A useful blueprint in 2010, \"Listen to Britain\" only became more relevant in a year consumed by the pandemic.Macdonald asked contributors to record videos with honesty and avoid the glossy representation of life that's typical of social media.Macdonald's own social experiment received over 320,000 submissions this time, totaling some 15,000 hours -- over a year and half's worth of video. A team selected approximately 500 hours of footage for the director and his three editors, who whittled it down to 15 hours of \"really amazing stuff,\" out of which they cut an 86-minute film. Read More\"The quality of the material was so much higher (than in 2010),\" he says, and \"much more diverse,\" with submissions from 192 countries.In pictures: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about this yearStructured as a microcosm of life itself, the film begins with birth and ends in old age. The pandemic weaves its way across the narrative, from high school graduations at home to footage of the AstraZeneca vaccine in development, but it never dominates. Common threads including love and rites of passage are combined into montages. Characters including an opera-singing doctor in Lagos, Nigeria, seize their moment to shine, while others, such as a big-dreaming Russian boy, come in and out of focus.Tragedy and joy stand shoulder to shoulder, along with every other emotion, coexisting in all places at all times -- and it's the emotional resonance of the videos more than anything that unites the film's disparate parts.  \"We are trying to tap into the subconscious of the world,\" says the director. \"The trick of it is to make people feel like there is a story, even though in reality there isn't,\" he adds.\"The trick of it is to make people feel like there is a story, even though in reality there isn't,\" Macdonald says of stringing together a narrative out of the large selection of clips.Some critics have questioned whether the format has been outmoded by social media and new video platforms. If a documentary is made of the same composite parts, how does it remain distinct?\"The key thing is that it's curated,\" Macdonald says. \"What makes it art, I think, is that it has an individual's point of view on it -- and that individual happens to be me. And if you disagree with my selection, or the emphasis I've given something, or the use of music, you know who to come to.\"Read: Cinema is finally getting to grips with dementia\"Life in a Day 2020\" hops around the world sharing snapshots of peoples' lives. \"So many people share the same basic fundamental fears, desires and loves,\" says director Kevin Macdonald.In an age when self-expression is dominated by social media and a story's reach is often dictated by algorithm, Macdonald argues there is value in plugging humans into the selection process. Social media presents \"overwhelming quantity,\" he says, \"I feel like I want a way to navigate through (it).\" (There is an irony that the film is distributed by YouTube, where over 500 hours of video are uploaded every minute.)  That said, the film doesn't ignore the impact of social media altogether, choosing to bundle influencers into a montage that stands in contrast with everything else. Their peculiar brand of online hyper-reality is presented almost as a curio: exhibit A of what Macdonald didn't ask for, but a part of today's reality nonetheless.McDonald says he encouraged contributors \"to forget about that and to try and film things honestly.\" We see a couple struggling to conceive a child, a failed marriage proposal and a sick man discussing his illness with a young girl -- life unvarnished, in other words.  \"I'm so grateful to those people,\" he adds. \"They're braver than I am, to be able to actually show these things.\"Behind all these testimonies is the same fundamental motivation that has driven humans to tell their stories since time immemorial -- one best expressed by a man called Semyon, filming himself in northern Siberia. Alone in the wilderness, he tells the camera, \"what I fear the most is that my life will pass unnoticed; that my name won't matter in the history of the world.\" \"He has the same impulse that so many people have,\" says Macdonald. \"It's not about vanity ... It's, 'I want people to recognize that I'm here.'\" With no signs that humans will cease sharing their stories any time soon, the director may be granted his wish for a third edition of \"Life in A Day\" in 2030.The world may look somewhat different then, but some things won't have changed. \"So many people share the same basic fundamental fears, desires and loves,\" he says. \"There is beauty in the everyday.\"  Photos: What to watch: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about\"Spencer\" (directed by Pablo Larrain) -- Larrain's 2016 drama \"Jackie,\" featuring a never-better Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy, was not your average biopic, which leaves us intrigued as to what the Chilean director will do with Princess Diana. Starring Kristen Stewart (pictured), the film will revolve around one weekend at the Sandringham Estate in December 1991, when the princess mulls over the prospect of leaving Prince Charles. \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" cinematographer Claire Mathon is behind the camera and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is handling the score, with an autumn 2021 launch planned.\"Spencer\" is one of many new and exciting projects in the works.

Hopefully Villeneuve will fare better with his big-budget, two-part blockbuster starring Timothe\u00e9 Chalamet (pictured), Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac. The first part of this slice of politically-minded science fiction has been pushed back to October (which means you have no excuse not to finish the book). Easily the most anticipated Warner Bros. title slated to debut on HBO Max this year (CNN shares a parent company), the decision to move to the streaming platform has been criticized by some -- including the director himself.

Featuring standout turns from Swinton Byrne, mum Tilda Swinton and Burke as a bad boyfriend for the ages, it didn't put a foot wrong. It hardly needs to be said that the prospect of Part II has us on tenterhooks. Indie film darling/Batman Robert Pattinson was lined up to co-star, but scheduling conflicts meant he dropped out. Instead the role has been reportedly split in two, with Harris Dickinson (\"County Lines\") and Charlie Heaton (\"Stranger Things\") taking over.

The film's hilarious premise has some serious talent behind it; Lee is working from a screenplay co-written with artistic director of the Young Vic theater Kwame Kwei-Armah, and songs and music are by Tony award-winner Stew Stewart and nominee Heidi Rodewald.

Starring Kirsten Dunst, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons, the US-set plot follows the fate of polar-opposite brothers Phil and George Burbank, and the fallout when George marries local widow Rose. Cumberbatch as sadistic brother Phil mounting a campaign against Dunst's Rose sounds like great casting for this pyschodrama. Filmed in New Zealand in 2020, it will be released by Netflix later this year.Hide Caption 26 of 37 Photos: What to watch: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about\"The Matrix 4\" (directed by Lana Wachowski) -- One of cinema's most influential sci-fi franchises returns after an 18-year hiatus with Lana Wachowski writing and directing.

Selected for Cannes 2020, \"Gagarine\" missed out on a grand debut when the festival was cancelled, but the film has fared well at other festivals.Hide Caption 28 of 37 Photos: What to watch: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about\"Nine Days\" (directed by Edson Oda) -- We love high concept sci-fi that takes a swing, and Edson Oda takes a big one with his existential feature debut.

One of the most interesting actors of his generation will be aided by a stacked supporting cast including Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as The Riddler and Colin Farrell as The Penguin. Covid-related interruptions to Reeves' film -- including Pattinson contracting the virus -- mean we'll have to wait until March 2022 for its release, but a spin-off series on HBO Max is already in the works.Hide Caption 30 of 37 Photos: What to watch: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about\"Old\" (directed by M.

That team was captained by an imperious Kapil Dev, played here by Ranveer Singh (pictured), who spearheads a cast that includes Tahir Raj Bhasin as legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar and Deepika Padukone as Dev's wife Romi. Scheduled for release in India in June, sporting biopics don't come much bigger.Hide Caption 32 of 37 Photos: What to watch: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about\"House of Gucci\" (directed by Ridley Scott) -- Based on the novel \"The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed,\" Scott's movie stars Adam Driver as Maurizio Gucci and Lady Gaga as his wife Patrizia Reggiani in a real-life tale of crime and couture. The fashion boss was shot outside his office in Milan in 1995, with Reggiani sentenced to 29 years in prison for orchestrating the assassination.

Expect fireworks and plenty of wit -- Glover and Waller-Bridge appeared together in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" and their banter was one of the film's highlights.Hide Caption 35 of 37 Photos: What to watch: The movies and TV shows we're most excited about\"Lord of the Rings\" (J.D. Payne & Patrick McKay showrunners) -- Peter Jackson's trilogy (pictured) was a box office titan and critical hit, so it makes sense that Amazon is going all-out with its TV series (which, it should be noted, has nothing to do with Jackson). It's set thousands of years before \"The Lord of the Rings,\" with writers mining J.R.R. Tolkien's prequel novel \"The Silmarillion\" for material. While the cast is new to Middle-earth, the setting will look familiar to audiences -- filming took place in New Zealand.

", "full_article_text": " (CNN)Betty White, the self-described \"lucky old broad\" whose sweetly sarcastic senior citizen characters were a beloved fixture on TV shows and movies such as \"The Golden Girls,\" \"Boston Legal\" and \"Hot in Cleveland,\" died Friday, her agent and close friend Jeff Witjas told People magazine in a statement. At 99, she was just weeks away from celebrating her 100th birthday on Jan. 17.\"Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever,\" Witjas said. \"I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I don't think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again.\"CNN has reached out to Witjas for comment.For the first half of her career -- eventually honored by Guinness World Records as the longest television career by a female entertainer -- White was a regular, but not widely noticed, presence on radio and television. Read MoreThere were '50s sitcoms, a 1954 talk show and even a role in the 1962 film \"Advise and Consent.\" She'd pop up on game shows occasionally, particularly \"Password,\" hosted by her third husband, Allen Ludden. \"It was a little out of character, a little unfeminine, to be ... you shouldn't be funny,\" White recalled in a 2017 interview with CNN, reminiscing about her early days in Hollywood. Noting that women at the time were expected to simply \"come in and be pretty,\" White countered: \"No, it's so much more fun to get that laugh.\" But starting with her performance as acerbic kitchen diva Sue Ann Nivens on the 1970s sitcom \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" -- beginning when she was 51 -- White developed a knack for portraying the apparently pure-hearted elder, full of Midwestern sincerity, who had a randy inner life. In doing so, she created a new generation of fans, a base that only grew larger as she entered her 90s. She was the sexually experienced, if otherwise na\u00efve, Rose Nylund on \"The Golden Girls.\" White also played a flinty and sometimes violent secretary on \"Boston Legal.\" She had a guest spot on \"The Simpsons,\" hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" -- the oldest person ever to do so -- and even appeared in a self-mocking ad for Snickers candy bars. Through it all, she took her success -- if not her work -- lightly. \u202f\"I'm having the time of my life, and the fact that I'm still working -- how lucky can you get?\" she told the Huffington Post in 2012. \u202fBetty White was meant to be on television. When she was just 17, in 1939, she was on an experimental TV broadcast. The technology was still in its infancy, having made its public debut at the 1939 New York World's Fair. \u202f\"I danced on an experimental TV show, the first on the West Coast, in downtown Los Angeles,\" she told Guinness World Records. \"I wore my high school graduation dress, and our Beverly Hills High student body president, Harry Bennett, and I danced the 'Merry Widow Waltz.' \" White was a native of the Midwest, born in Oak Park, Illinois, on January 17, 1922. (Her name was officially Betty, not Elizabeth.) Her mother was a homemaker, and her father was an executive for an electrical company. When she was 2, her family moved to the Los Angeles area, where her father started manufacturing radios. During the Depression, business got so tight at, at one point, he traded them for dogs, hoping that would turn into a business. White remembered her family having about 20 dogs at one point. She became a lifelong animal lover. \u202fWhite attended Beverly Hills High School and, at one point, wrote a play in which she cast herself as the lead. \"I guess that's when the bug bit,\" she told the Archive of American Television. \u202fWhite became a model after the TV appearance, though her career was interrupted by World War II, in which she served in the American Women's Voluntary Services. \u202fAfter the war, she worked in theater and eventually started picking up radio roles on shows such as \"The Great Gildersleeve\" and \"Blondie.\" In 1949, a Los Angeles radio host, Al Jarvis, asked her to be his \"girl Friday\" for a 5 1/2-hour live TV show that was intended to be his radio show on television but quickly turned into a loose variety-talk show, \"Hollywood on Television.\" \"It was like going to television college,\" she recalled. After a little more than two years, White became the sole host. She segued into other programs: a syndicated show, \"Life with Elizabeth\"; an NBC sitcom, \"Date with the Angels\"; the first of four programs named \"The Betty White Show\"; hosting parades -- \"it got so that, if a signal would go red and six cars would line up, I'd announce them,\" she said; and a variety of commercials and appearances. White even had her own production company, a rarity for a woman at the time.

Later, the two worked together in summer stock and got to be good friends. Ludden, a widower, became an ardent pursuer and actually bought White -- a two-time divorcee reluctant to marry again -- a wedding ring, courting her in Los Angeles through transcontinental trips from his home in New York. She finally accepted a year later when he bought her earrings and a stuffed bunny for Easter, the latter an appeal to her love of animals. \u202f\"I came to the point of regretting that year that I wasted saying 'no.' I would have given anything to have it back,\" she said of her love affair with Ludden. They were married for 18 years until Ludden's death of cancer in 1981. White never remarried. \u202fFor much of the '60s and into the '70s, White worked steadily but quietly, with frequent talk show and game show appearances and the occasional guest slot. (At one point, she was asked to become part of the \"Today Show\" team.) In the early '70s, she hosted the syndicated \"The Pet Set,\" which featured celebrities and their animals. American actress Mary Tyler Moore (as Mary Richards) (left) gives a 'thumbs up' sign as she sits at her desk with Betty White (as Sue Ann Nivens) in a scene from 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' in 1975.\u202fWhite and Ludden had many friends, including Mary Tyler Moore and her producer husband, Grant Tinker. At the urging of \"MTM\" casting director Ethel Winant, White was cast as Sue Ann Nivens, the \"Happy Homemaker,\" sweetness and light while doing her cooking show but a man-hungry harridan off-camera. Originally meant to be a one-off -- Nivens was having an affair with the husband of another character -- by the time the episode ended, the chemistry was so strong that White became a regular. She won two Emmys for the role. White loved working with the cast but observed that \"the magic of the show was the writing. ... It was a magnificent combination.\" White hit paydirt again a decade later when she was cast as Rose on \"The Golden Girls,\" the 1985-92 show about four senior women sharing a Miami house. The script was \"dynamite,\" White recalled. She was originally slotted for the role Blanche, the lascivious widow played by Rue McClanahan, but director Jay Sandrich -- who'd worked with White on \"MTM\" -- didn't want her to repeat herself and suggested Rose. The cast hit it off beautifully, White recalled. \"It's like four points on a compass,\" she recalled. \"That's why we fit together so well.\" The show won a slew of Emmys over its seven-season run, including one for White. Betty White as Rose Nylund in \"The Golden Girls.\"White was never really out of the public eye. After \"The Golden Girls\" went off the air, she still worked, whether as a spokeswoman for animal welfare -- she was a trustee of the Morris Animal Foundation for more than 40 years -- or as a guest star on various TV shows. But even she wasn't prepared for the resurgence in popularity that accompanied her appearance in the 2009 film \"The Proposal,\" in which she played Ryan Reynolds' grandmother. At the 2010 Screen Actors Guild Awards, she received a Life Achievement honor, cheekily introduced by \"Proposal\" co-star Sandra Bullock as \"a seriously annoying person.\"\u202f After receiving a long ovation, she gave as good as she got. \"Isn't it heartening to see how far a girl as plain as she is can go?\" she said of Bullock. Later, she added, \"I am still, to this day, starstruck. I look out at this audience, and I see so many famous faces. But what really boggles my mind is, I actually know many of you, and I've worked with quite a few. Maybe,\" she added, \"had a couple. And you know who you are.\" And then she got serious. \u202f\"This is the highest point of my professional life,\" she said. \"Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"\" allowfullscreen>Years later, she still wondered why she'd suddenly started attracting attention again. \u202f\"I don't know where the 'comeback' story came (from),\" she told Oprah Winfrey in 2015. \"I've been working steadily for the last 70 years!\" \u202fBut it never stopped for Betty White. There was the Snickers commercial. The \"SNL\" appearance. Another series, \"Hot in Cleveland,\" and appearances on \"Community,\" \"Save Me\" (as God) and even \"WWF Raw.\" She had a Twitter account with more than a million followers. She never took any of it for granted, remaining the same down-to-earth, slightly impish, engaging woman the public first saw many decades before.  \"I am the luckiest old broad on two feet,\" she told CNN in 2017. \"I'm still able to get a job, at this age.

He starred as the widowed father of three girls on ABC's \"Full House\" and then as host of the network's \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" clip show. As Saget recalled to Jake Tapper in a July 2021 interview, the track of his career was unexpected. \"'Full House' was an accident,\" he said. \"I got fired on CBS and was asked to be in 'Full House.'\" The sitcom, which starred Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin and twins Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen in one role, ran for eight seasons. It lived on in syndication with strong enough nostalgia surrounding it that Netflix picked up a spin-off in 2016, \"Fuller House,\" starring Bure but featuring frequent appearances from original stars, including Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos.

Saget's reputation for reveling in a much edgier brand of comedy could be seen in movies like \"The Aristocrats\" -- exploring the competition among comics to tell the filthiest version of the same joke -- and his guest stint on HBO's \"Entourage\" as a version of himself.Asked by Esquire to define his humor in a 2013 interview, Saget explained, \"I am basically just a nine-year-old boy that evolved.\" Toward that end, Saget seemed to relish pushing back against his success in squeaky-clean shows, telling dirty jokes at ABC events to make the executives squirm.'Full House' co-star John Stamos and more remember Bob SagetSaget was in the midst of a tour at the time of his death that was set to take him to locations in New York, Canada and several other locations in the coming months.

Jennifer Seeger, who survived the attack, said she had seen the man and thought his get-up was part of the entertainment for the film's debut.She said the man first shot toward the ceiling, then began shooting at people. He reloaded during his attack, she said.\"He was just literally just massacring anybody that got up that was trying to run away,\" Seeger said.As of Friday afternoon, 30 people remained hospitalized, 11 of them in critical condition, according to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.Holmes is scheduled to appear in an Arapahoe County, Colorado, courtroom Monday morning, Rob McCallum, spokesman for the Colorado Judicial Department, said Friday. The court file was sealed, according to a court order. He is being held in the Arapahoe County jail, Oates said.A statement from Holmes' family in San Diego asked for \"privacy during this difficult time.\"\"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" the statement said, adding, \"We are still trying to process this information.\"Shooting turns movie into surreal horror: 'This is real'The FBI is assisting in the investigation, officials said, though it did not appear that the incident was related to terrorism.Prior to Friday's shooting, Holmes' criminal record in Aurora consisted only of a traffic summons.Aspiring sports reporter feared dead in shootingPresident Barack Obama canceled campaign events Friday, telling supporters at what had been scheduled as a rally in Fort Myers, Florida, that \"there will be other days for politics.\"\"This will be a day for prayer and reflection,\" he said, calling for the country to unite as one and support the victims.Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff Friday afternoon in honor of the victims.iReporter witness: 'We have to run'A law enforcement source said two of the guns used in the attack were purchased at a Bass Pro Shop in Denver, while the two others were bought at separate Gander Mountain Guns outlets in the area. Investigators also found a drum magazine, capable of carrying 100 rounds of ammunition, which was attached to the AR-15 rifle, two law enforcement officials said. KWGN: Witnesses first thought gunfire was part of movieA statement from Bass Pro Shops said its Denver store followed appropriate protocol on the sale of the two weapons.Authorities also searched the suspect's car in the parking lot of the movie theater and found more magazines and ammunition, a federal law enforcement official said.\"It was everywhere,\" the official said.Opinion: Gun control won't stop mass murderChristopher Nolan, director of \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" condemned the shooting as \"savage\" and \"appalling.\"\"The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me,\" Nolan said in a statement on behalf of the cast and crew of the film. \"Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families.\"Four Aurora theaters showing \"The Dark Knight Rises\" will have extra security for the foreseeable future \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Oates said.Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, canceled the movie's Paris premiere, while New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said his officers would watch over screenings of \"The Dark Knight\" in the city to prevent copycat shootings. AMC Theatres, meanwhile, said it would not permit guests in costumes that make others uncomfortable, nor will it allow face-covering masks or fake weapons. 911 tape: 'I need somebody to shut this movie off'Aurora, a Denver suburb, is about 13 miles from Littleton, Colorado -- site of the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre.In that incident, two teenage students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, armed themselves with guns and bombs and shot people inside the high school.

It was obvious from the start.He was a brawny former Maine lobsterman with a booming baritone.  She was a redhead with freckles from Wisconsin who worked in corporate recruiting. They talked about everything from sci-fi movies and her love for the rock group Bon Jovi to whether the Lord of the Rings film trilogy did justice to J.R.R. Tolkien's books. He asked for permission to kiss her on their first date. She said yes.When Ian and Michelle Horne got married, he wore a purple tie on their wedding day because it was her favorite color.  As the years rolled by, they got matching tattoos and gave each other nicknames from the movie, \"The Princess Bride.\" He called her Princess Buttercup and she called him \"Farm Boy Wesley.\" They made plans to visit Ireland this year to celebrate her Irish roots. Then came the pandemic. Last fall, after a long battle, Michelle Horne died from complications caused by Covid-19. Ian Horne's \"superpower,\" as he called her, was gone. They had been married almost 10 years. But not long after his wife's death, the morning radio deejay in Wichita, Kansas, wondered if Michelle was still speaking to him. He was driving to his job in the predawn darkness when he spotted something odd. About two dozen streetlights flanking the highway had turned purple. They looked like a lavender string of pearls glowing in the night sky. Michelle and Ian Horne. The couple were married almost 10 years.Read MoreHorne took it as a sign. \"Michelle knew that was my route to work that I take every morning and was the route she took on her final drive to the hospital,\" says Horne, who hosts his morning show on 101.3 KFDI as \"JJ Hayes.\" \"I remember simply smiling and feeling overwhelmed with the idea that Michelle was close.\"Reported encounters with departed loved ones are not uncommonThe coronavirus pandemic has now killed more than 600,000 Americans. Many of us never had a chance to hug or say farewell to loved ones who died alone and isolated in hospital wards due to fears of spreading the virus. But there is another group of pandemic survivors who say they have been granted a second chance to say goodbye. They are people like Horne who believe they've been contacted by a loved one who died from coronavirus.These experiences can be subtle: relatives appearing in hyper-real dreams, a sudden whiff of fragrance worn by a departed loved one, or unusual behavior by animals. Other encounters are more dramatic: feeling a touch on your shoulder at night, hearing a sudden warning from a loved one, or seeing the full-bodied form of a recently departed relative appear at the foot of your bed. These stories may sound implausible, but they are in fact part of a historical pattern. There is something in us -- or in our lost loved ones -- that won't accept not being able to say goodbye.And whenever there is a massive tragedy such as a pandemic, a war or a natural disaster, there is a corresponding surge in reports of people seeing the dead or trying to contact them.After mass tragedies such as wars many Americans have turned to Ouija boards in an attempt to contact departed loved ones.The 1918 influenza epidemic sparked a \"spiritualism craze\" as Americans turned to seances and Ouija boards to contact departed loved ones. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks came a wave of people reporting sightings of and even conversations with those who had been snatched from their lives. When a tsunami struck Japan in 2011, killing at least 20,000 people, so many inhabitants of Ishinomaki reported seeing their loved ones appear that a book and a documentary were made about this city of wandering ghosts. \"These kind of reports are normal in my world,\" says Scott Janssen, an author who has worked in the hospice field for years and studies these experiences. \"It would make sense that in a pandemic or other event that leads to mass deaths that there will be a numerical increase in reports and experiences, given the shared grief and trauma.\"Read more from John Blake:The look in Derek Chauvin's eyes was something worse than hateThere was no racial reckoningDid Black lives matter to Abraham Lincoln?

His life hasn't been the same sinceHow 'good White people' derail racial progressThese experiences are so common in the psychological field that there is a name for them: ADCs, or \"after death communications.\" Research suggests at least 60 million Americans have these experiences, and that they occur across cultures, religious beliefs, ethnicities and income levels. Many of these encounters occur in the twilight state between sleeping and waking, but others have been reported by people who were alert.Bill Guggenheim, co-author of \"Hello from Heaven,\" a book that explores ADCs, believes there is a spiritual purpose behind the visits. \"They want you to know they're still alive, and that you'll be reunited with them when it's your turn to leave your lifetime on Earth,\" he writes. \"They want to assure you they'll be there to meet you and greet you -- and perhaps even to assist you -- as you make your own transition.\"A dining room encounter with a beloved auntADCs may serve another function in the world created by Covid -- to reassure people who couldn't be at the side of their loved ones when they died. Consider the story of Jamie Jackson, an office manager who lives near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and her beloved \"Aunt Pat.\" Jackson's aunt died of a heart attack last summer after complications from Covid. Jackson said her aunt was like a mother to her -- someone she spent summers with and accompanied to the hospital for routine medical visits.But when her aunt was afflicted with Covid, Jackson couldn't visit the hospital to reassure her. \"That was the hardest thing,\" Jackson says. \"You can't say goodbye and you can't be there as an advocate for your loved one, which is difficult because you have somebody who's in the hospital, who's scared and not used to being alone.\"Gloves worn by pallbearers are draped on the casket of retired officer Charles Jackson Jr., who died from Covid-19 in April 2020 in Los Angeles. Covid restrictions prevented many people from saying goodbye to dying loved ones in person.Seven months later, though, Jackson says she heard from her aunt again.It was December, and Jackson was putting up Christmas decorations in the house while Bing Crosby sang holiday carols. Christmas was one of her aunt's favorite holidays, and she loved decorating. Jackson's bin was filled with the same decorations that once belonged to her aunt.Jackson says she left the bin in her hallway to get something and when she returned, she saw a translucent figure peering into it. It was the figure of a petite woman, with the same haircut, color of hair and white blouse and blue slacks that her aunt used to wear. Jackson froze. Her hearted started pounding. She fled to her dining room and started crying. When she returned, the figure was gone. She says it was her aunt.\"It was overwhelming,\" Jackson says. \"It's hard to put into words. I felt touched by that. It's obvious that she's around and she's visiting me.\"A cold hand on a shoulder and a whiff of perfume  Some post-Covid paranormal encounters are even more dramatic.  One woman says she was literally touched by a loved one who died from complications from Covid. Marie Pina teaches English as a second language in Manitoba, Canada.  She says her 79-year-old mother, Inez, was about to be released from the hospital last November when there was a Covid outbreak in her ward. She tested positive and was put in isolation. She returned home the next month, but had lost her strength. About four months after her diagnosis, her mother died. On the morning of her mother's death, Pina says she was reaching for her slippers in her bedroom when she felt a cold hand on her shoulder. She turned and saw her mother sitting beside her, staring straight ahead with no expression. She looked 20 years younger.\"Her touch was cold, like she had just come from outside,\" Pina says.Family members gather to mourn a lost relative at the Continental Funeral Home on December 20, 2020 in East Los Angeles.One day not long after that morning, Pina reported another classic characteristic of an ADC. She was making spinach soup, one of her mom's favorites, when she suddenly smelled the fragrance associated with her mother -- a combination of White Diamond perfume and her mom's Chi hairspray.\"The scent was overpowering,\" Pina says. \"My husband and I stood in the kitchen awestruck as I stirred the soup. We both could smell it. It lasted for approximately five minutes before evaporating.\"Talk to people who have these experiences, and many will acknowledge that maybe their minds created the episode. Others insist the visitations were too real to deny. Jackson, who lost her aunt, says it's almost irrelevant if they're real or not. Their impact is real, she says. They made her feel better. \"If I needed to see it and it made me feel better and that's all it was, I'm okay with that,\" she says. \"I tell people if they don't want to believe me, that's fine. I don't need to explain to other people.\"Some paranormal visitations aren't so welcomeOther ADCs are more chilling. Some paranormal experiences happen to people who are not reassured by them.\"Some people are creeped out by these things and are certainly not looking for them,\" says Janssen, the hospice worker.  \"For some it clashes with worldviews or religious beliefs. Some people have visits like this years after the fact when they are not grieving, or have visits from people with whom they have struggled and from whom they might not actually wish to have a visit.\"Many victims of coronavirus died alone in hospitals, depriving family members of closure.Haunting ADCs also are common during wartime. War memoirs are filled with stories of combat veterans reporting creepy, after-death visitations from fallen comrades or even enemy soldiers they've killed. In the classic memoir, \"What It Is like to Go to War,\" Karl Marlantes, a Vietnam veteran, wrote about how the ghost of a North Vietnamese soldier he killed stalked him years after he returned home.In one striking passage, Marlantes relates how he exorcised his enemy's ghost. He arranged a private mass with a priest at 2 in the morning at an old church where he says he saw the spirits of the enemies he killed and the comrades who died under his command file into the pews. Even his late grandparents appeared, smiling as if they approved.Counselors working with veterans often hear such stories, Janssen says.\"I've been doing this a long time and I consider it a near universal [phenomenon] that after a particularly heavy engagement, a lot of people in your unit are lost, it is inevitable that some of those troops are going to receive visits from their buddies,\" he says.An unusual bird sighting and a cry in the nightHorne, the radio DJ, reports having other after-death encounters with his late wife. Not long after she died, he was sitting on the deck in his backyard when a cardinal landed on a branch in front of him. Cardinals, according to folklore, often appear when loved ones are near. Horne was struck by the bird because he says cardinals don't normally show up in Kansas in autumn. Horne says he's had moments when he's clearly heard Michelle call to him in the night: \"Ian, wake up!\"\"It's as if she's in the room with me,\" he says. \"It's enough to snap me awake, and I'm a deep, hard sleeper. Call it an auditory hallucination or what you want, but I definitely hear it.\"Perceived messages from deceased loved ones can be comforting but also unsettling.Both signs are comforting to him in part because Horne remembers how Michelle fought so hard to live. He says her immune system was weakened after she received a kidney transplant several years ago. When the pandemic hit, they both dreaded what would happen if she got the virus.After their worst fears proved true, Horne says it seemed at first as if Michelle would survive. She endured a lengthy hospital stay, which included being put on a ventilator, but was released last October. She worked hard to get better, but there were times when Michelle's natural optimism wavered. Horne says she once told him, \"I'm such a burden to you. You don't deserve this. You should just leave.\"He kept encouraging her in physical therapy. \"I was in it for the long haul, for better or for worse,\" he says.Michelle's body, though, didn't have the strength for the long haul. She died from a heart attack last October, her body weakened by Covid, Horne says. She was 50. Horne's radio audience has rallied around him. He's shared his story on the air and it's been featured in local newspapers. He finds it cathartic to talk about Michelle. \"I feel that a person dies twice -- once when they have their physical death and the second time, when we stop saying their name,\" he says. \"Any opportunity I have to talk about Michelle, I will take it.\"Purple streetlights in Wichita, Kansas, which Ian Horne thinks are a signal from his late wife.Yet in an odd way, Michelle may be still talking to Horne, even after he first saw those purple streetlights.When they were married, Horne developed a ritual with Michelle. She worried about his safety driving to work in the dark each morning. After he arrived, he would reassure Michelle by texting: \"I'm here. I love you.\"The purple lights in Wichita are still shining. Horne keeps seeing them on his morning commute. It's as if Michelle is responding with a similar message.He's not sure how long the purple lights will remain. He called the city of Wichita and they attributed the faulty lights to a defective batch. They told him they were going to replace the lights. He's in no rush for that to happen.\"I'm kind of honestly hoping that they don't,\" Horne says.  \"I will always believe that Michelle turned them purple. Whether she actually did or not, that's up to a reader or viewer to decide. They can explain it away ... I believe it was a way for Michelle to be with me on my ride to work.\"And I hope they never change.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2020", "month": "11", "day": "13"}, "text": {"headline": "app-news-section", "text": "A backyard roller coaster, a high-speed ride through the desert, and a royal surprise for a young girl.

The rapper, born Christopher Wallace, was killed when his vehicle came under fire as he and his entourage left an industry party.It feels like only yesterday that I was writing about the 20th anniversary of his death on March 9, 1997.Wallace's murder has never been solved, but his musical influence remains. As is often the case with those who die young, his mythology has grown over the years even as many wonder where both he and his career would be now had he lived.Hip-hop has aged well \u2014 as was displayed at this year's Super Bowl \u2014 but count me as one who wishes that both Wallace and Tupac Shakur, who was gunned down six months before Biggie, had lived to see it. \nWhat did you like about today's newsletter?

(HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)\"And Just Like That...\" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger \u2014 Sunk Cost Streaming. \"Sex and the City\" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of \"And Just Like That...\": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of \"And Just Like That...\" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in \"SATC\" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the \"Sex and the City\" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, \"I'm in a rom-com!,\" I paused the episode to cringe. \"No, Miranda,\" I thought, \"you're in a tragedy.\" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in \"And Just Like That...,\" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them \"soon\" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that? If \"And Just Like That...\" has any plans for yet another chapter, there's no doing it without Samantha. (I won't hold my breath for her return.)The very bestKristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon -- Before watching every new episode of \"And Just Like That...,\" I felt the same knots in my stomach that I get before getting on a roller coaster or walking down wet stairs in high heels. That doesn't happen if you aren't deeply invested in something. Like it or not, \"Sex and the City\" lovers, you haven't been hate watching -- you've been care watching. And we care because Parker, Davis and Nixon have embodied their characters so fully, so second-naturedly, that each woman and their life feels real. We're angry at Miranda, we wanted Carrie to pick up the phone faster to call an ambulance, we cringed when Charlotte made a shameful mistake at a dinner party. They are incredible talents who've told decades of story through three distinct pairs of eyes, and for that, we can't be anything but grateful. As we've learned, it's crucial to enjoy a ride while it is happening, because it can be over just like that.

As the last of the sleepaway campers begrudgingly say their goodbyes to bunkmates this month, it's worth remembering that some campers and counselors keep the campfire flames burning much longer with summer flings that become lifetime commitments. Alex and future husband Eric Spitz at Camp JCA ShalomA first -- and last -- kiss\"I always went to camp kicking and screaming,\" Alex Spitz said of her early teenage years at Camp JCA Shalom in Malibu, California. Read MoreThat is, until a blond boy named Eric showed up to camp one summer.\"And then I never wanted to leave,\" she laughs. For two summers, Alex shared laughs and awkward slow dances with Eric, who \"always had this smile on his face, and his eyes twinkled.\" But -- if \"Grease\" taught anything about those summer nights -- as camp ended, so did their teenage romance. Fast-forward to 2006, when Alex signed up for the social networking site MySpace and one blast-from-the-past name popped into her mind: Eric Spitz.They both were in relationships at the time, but exchanged a few friendly messages. A year later, with both of them newly and conveniently single, Eric wrote Alex saying he would be in Los Angeles for his brother's wedding and asked if she would like to meet for a drink.Drinks turned into dinner, which five days later turned into plans to move cross-country -- Eric packed up two months later.Alex and Eric back where they began on their wedding dayIn 2008, when the topic of marriage crept up, they knew the only venue that would suit: Camp JCA Shalom. Alex phoned the director, knowing it wasn't a typical wedding venue. The only date the camp had free amid busy summer sessions was May 31, 2009.\"We'll take it,\" she said.They had a date and a venue, but no formal engagement, which came shortly after.\"I look back and am like 'We were crazy!' but it never felt like that,\" she says.The two married, surrounded by 150 friends and family, and shared a slightly less awkward slow dance right where it all started.Eric and Alex, now 34 and 33, live in Orange County with their two sons, who are already attending family weekend at the same camp where their parents met.Eric jokes Alex was his first -- and now last -- kiss.Steele Spence and the future Justine Spence at campWhen a wrong room turns out rightAs an avid skier during her adolescence, Justine Spence opted to attend a special off-season ski camp, World Mogul Camp, in Whistler, British Columbia. Instead of cabins, campers were put up in hotel rooms at a ski resort for their two-week summer sessions.As campers were getting settled in, Justine wanted to surprise a friend she had met on the competitive ski circuit and asked for her room number at the front desk.\"I ran in the room and yelled 'MEGAN!' -- then quickly realized it was not Megan,\" she says.Instead, she found \"a very cute boy with green eyes and a nice smile,\" who introduced himself as Steele Spence.

Follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life.\"The second that I met him, it was like a bolt of lightning,\" she says.The pair hung out all through the summer, and continued to rekindle their relationship each summer, even when Steele became a counselor. \"He would get his hand slapped for making out with me, because I was a camper!\" Justine says.Ski camp turned out to be a good investment for a few reasons -- Steele went on to compete worldwide, in the X Games, and has since retired and been instrumental in creating judging criteria for slopestyle skiing, which made its Olympic debut in Sochi, Russia, in February. The couple will have been married four years this month and their relationship shows no signs of going downhill.A perfect rainy day activityBeigette Gill arrived at Portland International Jetport in Maine from her native Australia in 2002 with nothing but a backpack full of clothes. When a fellow camp counselor named Jim picked her up at the airport, little did she know she had met her life mate.During the off-season, the two began dating. As their second summer working together approached, Jim organized a marriage proposal during a camp assembly with plenty of whitewater-related puns about never knowing what's around the bend. Beigette's answer: \"Yes!\" But, they decided, why wait? So they made plans to get married that summer as well.When Beigette and Jim showed up at town hall to make arrangements, the town clerk asked if she could do the ceremony with people who knew them, to ensure it wasn't just a ploy to get a green card for Beigette. The couple thought of Camp Fernwood's director, not to mention the 300 campers who had witnessed their proposal earlier that summer.Meanwhile, the camp director was trying to come up with a \"rainy day activity\" when the perfect backup plan walked in the door -- Jim and Beigette. Jim and Beigette Gill tie the knotThe whole camp pitched in on the big day of July 18, 2003. One of the counselors let Beigette borrow a white dress, the senior campers straightened her hair and did her makeup, a camper played Pachelbel's \"Canon in D\" on the piano, the camp's chef made a multi-tiered wedding cake, and the silversmithing department even made rings for the couple. The clerk showed up and performed the ceremony in the camp's main hall.Getting married at camp ensured the ceremony was simple, with little pomp, circumstance and fretting beforehand.\"There was no fighting over the color of the place napkins,\" Jim Gill says.The couple has since purchased a camp nearby, Fernwood Cove, where they live year-round with their son, Perrin, 4\u00bd, and daughter Sylvie, 6\u00bd. Jim and Beigette GillThe Gills have experienced adversity as well, with Beigette suffering a traumatic spinal cord injury during a family bike trip after camp season in 2011. Support and encouragement from family members and Fernwood Cove campers have helped Beigette along her road to recovery.  And to think it all started when an American camp counselor gave his Aussie colleague a ride from the airport.\"You never know where camp will lead you,\" Jim says.

They say it happened on movie sets, at his company\u00a0and in interviews.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)A young production assistant thought she had landed the job of her dreams when, in the summer of 2015, she started work on \"Going In Style,\" a bank heist comedy starring Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Alan Arkin.But the job quickly devolved into several months of harassment, she told CNN. She alleges that Freeman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments about her figure and clothing on a near-daily basis. Freeman would rest his hand on her lower back or rub her lower back, she said. In one incident, she said, Freeman \"kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear.\" He never successfully lifted her skirt, she said -- he would touch it and try to lift it, she would move away, and then he'd try again. Eventually, she said, \"Alan [Arkin] made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn't know what to say.\"Freeman's alleged inappropriate behavior was not limited to that one movie set, according to other sources who spoke to CNN. A woman who was a senior member of the production staff of the movie \"Now You See Me\" in 2012 told CNN that Freeman sexually harassed her and her female assistant on numerous occasions by making comments about their bodies. \"He did comment on our bodies... We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,\" she said.Read MoreAt 80 years old, Freeman is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, with a movie career that spans nearly five decades. His starring roles in movies like \"Driving Miss Daisy\" and \"Shawshank Redemption\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s made him a household name. He won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for 2004's \"Million Dollar Baby,\" and has earned four other Oscar nominations. His voiceover work has also become iconic, including his narration for the Academy Award-winning documentaries \"The Long Way Home\" and \"March of the Penguins.\"Morgan Freeman won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for \"Million Dollar Baby.\"In all, 16 people spoke to CNN about Freeman as part of this investigation, eight of whom said they were victims of what some called harassment and others called inappropriate behavior by Freeman. Eight said they witnessed Freeman's alleged conduct. These 16 people together described a pattern of inappropriate behavior by Freeman on set, while promoting his movies and at his production company Revelations Entertainment.Of those 16, seven people described an environment at Revelations Entertainment that included allegations of harassment or inappropriate behavior by Freeman there, with one incident allegedly witnessed by Lori McCreary, Freeman's co-founder in the enterprise, and another in which she was the target of demeaning comments by Freeman in a public setting. One of those seven people alleged that McCreary made a discriminatory remark regarding a female candidate for a job at the Producers Guild of America, where McCreary is co-president. Four people who worked in production capacities on movie sets with Freeman over the last ten years described him as repeatedly behaving in ways that made women feel uncomfortable at work. Two, including the production assistant on \"Going in Style\" whose skirt he allegedly attempted to lift, said Freeman subjected them to unwanted touching. Three said he made public comments about women's clothing or bodies. But each of them said they didn't report Freeman's behavior, with most saying it was because they feared for their jobs. Instead, some of the women -- both on movie sets and at Revelations -- said, they came up with ways to combat the alleged harassment on their own, such as by changing the way they dressed when they knew he would be around.  CNN reached out to dozens more people who worked for or with Freeman. Some praised Freeman, saying they never witnessed any questionable behavior or that he was a consummate professional on set and in the office.Several other times during this investigation, when a CNN reporter contacted a person who had worked with Freeman to try to ask them if they had seen or been subjected to inappropriate behavior by an actor they had worked with -- not initially even naming the actor they were asking about -- the person would immediately tell them they knew exactly who the reporter had in mind: Morgan Freeman. Some of those people were sources for this investigation while others declined to comment further or did not want what they said used in this story.The pattern of behavior described by those who spoke with CNN shows another example of the systematic problems that exist in the entertainment industry. The allegations against Freeman are not about things that happened in private; they are about things that allegedly happened in public, in front of witnesses -- even in front of cameras. Before #MeToo, many men in the industry could behave without fear of consequences, because many times when a powerful man did so, it was the victim who suffered repercussions.CNN reached out to Freeman's spokesperson for comment and then, at his request, emailed him a detailed list of the accusations against Freeman. The spokesperson did not respond to multiple follow-ups by email seeking comment on the accusations. After this article was published, Freeman released a statement in which he said, \"Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2014 that was never my intent.\"CNN also reached out to a spokesperson for McCreary, and then provided her with a detailed list of accusations regarding Freeman's alleged behavior at Revelations and details of the accusation against her as well as a number of questions for her regarding Freeman's alleged behavior at Revelations and the environment there. The spokesperson did not respond to multiple follow-ups by email seeking comment. The allegations of inappropriate behavior by Freeman are not limited to the confines of his company or to movie sets. Three entertainment reporters who spoke to CNN said Freeman made inappropriate remarks to them during press junkets, which are publicity events for journalists who cover new films, typically attended by the movie's biggest stars. One of the three, CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas, the co-author of this article, says she was subjected to inappropriate behavior by Freeman more than a year ago, when she interviewed him at a press junket for \"Going in Style.\" According to Melas, who was six months pregnant at the time, Freeman, in a room full of people, including his co-stars Arkin and Caine, shook Melas' hand, not letting go while repeatedly looking her up and down and saying more than once a variation of, \"I wish I was there.\" She says he also said to her, \"You are ripe.\" Cameras were on and recording during one of Freeman's remarks to Melas -- \"Boy, do I wish I was there\" -- but not for the rest. As is common practice with such junkets, Melas was the only CNN employee there at the time.Afterward, Melas reported what had happened to her supervisor, who instructed her to inform CNN human resources. According to Melas, she was told that CNN HR contacted their counterparts at human resources for Warner Bros., which produced and distributed the movie, and which like CNN is owned by Time Warner. Melas said she was also told that Warner Bros. HR could not corroborate the account because only one of Freeman's remarks was on video and the Warner Bros. employees present did not notice anything. Melas and her supervisor agreed that she would not cover the movie. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. confirmed that what Melas was told was accurate, but declined to comment further. A representative for Caine declined to comment. A representative for Arkin said he was not available for comment. After the encounter with Freeman, Melas started making calls to see if other women had experienced anything similar, or whether this was an isolated incident. She soon learned that other women had similar stories -- and so she, and later her co-author, began this months-long reporting process.Inside Revelations EntertainmentFreeman and Lori McCreary founded Revelations Entertainment in 1996. Variety reported last year that Freeman started the company with McCreary because he was frustrated by the lack of choice roles for black actors and because he wanted to reveal the truth about serious issues -- a mission that inspired the name \"Revelations.\" The company's credits include a list of ambitious films about religion, apartheid, astronomy and stem cell research. Revelations also produced the film \"Along Came a Spider\" and the hit CBS show \"Madam Secretary,\" both of which feature strong female leads.Morgan Freeman and Lori McCreary, his business partner, speak at an event in New York City in 2016. But former staffers who spoke with CNN say that behind the fa\u00e7ade of a progressive and artistic agenda the company's two founders created what one called a \"toxic\" work environment. Six former staffers said they witnessed Freeman's questionable behavior around women, which they said included sexual comments and one said included an incident of unsolicited touching. One female former staffer said she was the target of sexual comments by Freeman.The female former employee at Revelations told CNN that Freeman was flanked by a group of men on the set of \"Through the Wormhole\" when she met the actor for the first time. He \"looked me up and down,\" she said, and then asked her, \"How do you feel about sexual harassment?\" \"I was stunned,\" she told CNN. \"This is the person that I worked for, this is his company, I didn't expect it at all ... I said timidly, 'I love it' in a sarcastic way hoping to make light of the situation because I was so confused and then he turned to the guys on the crew ... and said, 'See guys, this is how you do it.'\" One woman who was a manager at Revelations told CNN that sometimes Freeman would \"come over to my desk to say hi and he'd just stand there and stare at me. He would stare at my breasts.\"\"If I ever passed him he would stare at me in an awkward way, would look me up and down sometimes stopping and just staring,\" she said. \"One time he stopped, looked me up and down as I walked into a room of people, and everyone burst out laughing. And I literally froze feeling very uncomfortable and one of the people in the office said, 'Don't worry, that's just Morgan.'\"\"That sort of interaction was when I stopped wearing a skirt around the office when he was there,\" said the former manager. \"I can't say it was an accident that I'd be wearing a potato sack and a ponytail on certain days when he was there and do my best to avoid him when he was in the office.\"I stopped wearing a skirt around the office when he was there.A\u00a0former manager at Revelations, Morgan Freeman's production companyFreeman was not in the office on a daily basis, the former employees said. But when he did show up, he behaved like a \"creepy uncle,\" in the words of a male former employee. \"One time I witnessed Morgan walk up to an intern and start massaging her\" shoulder, he said. \"The intern got visibly red and wiggled out of his grasp, it was awkward.\" The incident stood out to him because Freeman was using only one hand to touch the intern, as his other was injured in a 2008 car accident that was widely covered by the press. Another former employee told CNN she was present when the male former employee told several people about this incident shortly after it occurred.CNN spoke to two male witnesses who each saw a separate occasion in which Freeman asked women to twirl. One instance occurred at the office, while another happened at an off-site company event.Another incident stood out to people who spoke with CNN who witnessed it. Two former staffers who were there, and a writer for the show \"Madam Secretary\" who also attended, each described the scene to CNN. For his 79th birthday, Revelations threw Freeman a party in the office. According to the sources, roughly 30 people attended the party, some of whom were new to the company and had never met the actor. McCreary was among those in attendance, the sources said. People at the party had to stand in a circle, a former executive at the company who attended the party told CNN, and tell Freeman who they were and what they did. Then, the former executive said, Freeman went up to women in the circle and would \"stand maybe within an inch of their face and just look them up and down and not say anything, and then would move on to the next woman and he'd stand like within an inch of their face and look them up and down and not say anything, and it was really, really strange.\" The former executive added, \"It was really weird and he did it to every woman but of course he didn't do it to any of the men. He didn't speak to any of the men.\" The writer for \"Madam Secretary\" who was at the party said, \"We saw Morgan go around to the girls in the circle and get really close to their faces, he didn't do it to the men. I don't know what he said but we all thought it was strange and couldn't wait to get the hell out of there. Absolutely there were sexual undertones to it.\" After the #MeToo movement began, the same writer said, writers on the show joked -- with that incident in mind -- \"that Morgan would be the next person to be called out.\"McCreary herself has also been the subject of demeaning comments by Freeman. In front of what was reportedly an audience of 400 people at 2016's Produced By conference, Freeman described what she was wearing during their first meeting, saying, \"She had on a dress cut to here.\" \"She wants to be thought of as serious,\" said Freeman of McCreary, who was on the same panel. \"But you can't get away from the short dresses.\" Freeman stood by his comments when he appeared a few days later on the \"Today\" show and host Savannah Guthrie said some people were \"surprised\" by the remarks he made on the panel.\"It was just something I said in jest about when I first met her, it was more than 20 years ago,\" he said to Guthrie. \"How is that news?\"The Hollywood Reporter reported at the time that McCreary \"did not visibly react to the comment.\" One of the former Revelations executives told CNN that McCreary was visibly upset when she returned to the office.\"I tried to console her and she was clearly upset and I think she was surprised and found it hurtful and embarrassing,\" said the former executive. \"She was devastated.\"We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms.A\u00a0senior member of the production staff for\u00a0the movie \"Now You See Me\"Five sources told CNN that there was no formal human resources department at Revelations at the time. There was a rotation of executives who served as the point of contact for HR issues, but former staffers said they did not feel comfortable talking to senior personnel about their workplace grievances. This prompted some staffers to form a \"survivors club\" where they gathered to vent about their experiences at Revelations, according to five sources who have been to the gatherings, which take place outside of the office.Publicly, McCreary champions the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. Two days before January's Screen Actors Guild awards, at which Freeman accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award, McCreary released a statement on behalf of the Producers Guild of America (PGA), to say that its board ratified new anti-sexual harassment guidelines for its members. \"The PGA is indebted to Time's Up as a resource in creating our protocols,\" she said in a press release issued with her co-president Gary Lucchesi, referring to the initiative aimed at fighting harassment and discrimination against women. Yet the former Revelations employee who said Freeman asked her how she felt about sexual harassment also alleged that on a phone call with a member of PGA, McCreary said of a candidate vying for a position at PGA East, \"she'll never be able to do a good job, she has a family.\" Two former senior level Revelations employees said McCreary would openly mock women who had to leave work early for family commitments and school functions. McCreary also allegedly said that some employees couldn't handle big workloads because they had to \"run home\" to their families and therefore couldn't stay late at work, according to one of the sources. She openly advocated for work-life balance, that source said, but she would make \"snide\" remarks to those who left work early.A spokesperson for the PGA said in a statement, \"The Producers Guild of America is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not question or consider marital or parental status in its hiring practices. As soon as CNN notified us about the allegation, we investigated the matter and have found that it has no merit. Lori McCreary is an outstanding PGA President. In all of her work with the Guild, she has been a consistent, vocal, and proactive advocate for women and all who are underrepresented in our community.\"A spokesperson for McCreary did not respond to repeated follow-up requests for comment regarding the allegations against McCreary. On setOne of the former male Revelations employees recounted to CNN what he called the \"shocking\" remarks that Freeman made while he was on set for a number of Freeman's movies. What he says he witnessed follows the pattern described by the women who said they were harassed by Freeman. \"[He'd say] things like 'I'd like to have an hour with her' or make vulgar and sexual comments about women,\" the former employee said. \"He would be verbally inappropriate and it was just shocking. You're more shocked than anything because it's hard to have the wherewithal to say to him 'That's inappropriate.' You're just like 'whoa.' It's hard because on any set he is the most powerful person on it. It's weird because you just don't expect it from Morgan Freeman, someone who you respect.\" Morgan Freeman at an event in California in 2016.The female production assistant (PA) mentioned at the beginning of this story who worked on \"Going In Style\" said she was in her early 20s when Freeman, then 78 years old, harassed her. She said the experience led to her decision to leave the movie industry.\"It was constant comments about the way I looked,\" she said, adding that Freeman often made the comments within earshot of others on the production staff. She said she frequently came home from work in tears. The woman recalled a time when she went to the set wearing a dress with a t-shirt over it to cover her exposed back, but \"Morgan said to me that I shouldn't be wearing the shirt over my dress.\"Another female production assistant who witnessed this particular alleged incident told CNN that Freeman's behavior towards the younger female production staff was an unchecked and persistent issue during filming. Both women said the t-shirt incident took place in front of a group of people and that they heard at least one other woman publicly chastise Freeman for that particular comment. The behavior was discussed among the women he targeted, the female production assistant said. A third woman who worked on a recent movie of Freeman's recalled an incident at the film's wrap party. \"He was looking at my breasts, and I told him, 'My eyes are up here.' Then we went to take a group photo and he pressed himself up against me. It was inappropriate.\"  CNN spoke to one of the woman's colleagues on the film, who said that as soon as the photo was taken, the woman walked over and told a group of people what Freeman had done to her.[W]e all joked that Morgan would be the next person to be called out in this #MeToo movement.\u00a0A writer for\u00a0\"Madam Secretary,\"\u00a0a CBS TV\u00a0show produced by Morgan Freeman's production companyAnother production assistant, who worked with Freeman on \"The Dark Knight,\" told CNN that although she was never personally targeted by Freeman, she witnessed some inappropriate comments Freeman made to female members of the crew. She also said that female members of the crew would at times discuss how Freeman had made them feel uncomfortable. \"Morgan did things in a way that an older more established person can get away with because they have that power,\" she told CNN. \"They can't be replaced, but you can be replaced very easily, that's just kind of the dynamic on set. PA's can be replaced, grips can be replaced, electricians can be replaced, but the actors -- once they're in, they're in. Had it been somebody else on the crew... I would feel comfortable reporting them because I wouldn't feel like my job would be in danger by reporting them, but if you report somebody like Morgan Freeman that the movie would lose a lot of money by replacing them or getting them in trouble, then you're the trouble maker and you'll get fired because you're just a PA.\"With reportersFreeman's alleged fixation on how women dressed was apparent when he hit the road to promote his films, as was his alleged pattern of looking women up and down while making sexually suggestive comments to them. As the entertainment producer at Chicago's WGN-TV, Tyra Martin spent hours interviewing Freeman at various press junkets. Over the course of a decade, she said, she sat down with him at least nine times and grew accustomed to his comments about her appearance. But Martin made it clear in an interview with CNN that she was always \"in on the joke.\" WGN produced videos featuring some of Freeman's remarks to Martin, describing it as him flirting with her. But Martin felt that one incident crossed a line.\"When I stood up, I pulled my skirt part of my dress down and he did say, 'Oh, don't pull it down now.'\" Martin said. \"That gave me pause but I never felt uncomfortable.\"It is unclear whether video of that incident exists.  An entertainment reporter who is a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Freeman made comments about her skirt and her legs during two different junkets. Much like many of the women in this report and those who declined to go on the record, the reporter said Freeman's fame and power kept her from speaking out.\"I was just trying to do my job and I brushed it off,\" said the reporter, who did not want to be identified for this story because she's fearful of losing out on interviews with other celebrities. \"You don't want to put him on the spot because one, he's famous and two, it's on camera and three, you just want to do your job.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2016", "month": "9", "day": "19"}, "text": {"headline": "us", "text": "Charmian Carr, best known for her role as Liesl in \"The Sound of Music,\" died Saturday at the age of 73, her website said.

But he feared that would be a tough sell -- not for audiences, who he felt would connect with a good story when they saw one -- but for would-be backers.\"My concern was, would anyone finance this film if it is not in English? ... I was in a position in which nobody knows who I am. Nobody knows what this story is,\" he said. \"You know, it's about a bunch of farmers who are chicken sexers.

She said as a producer, she's going to go out and make that case, and make that fight. And I just trusted her,\" he said.Some English is spoken in \"Minari.\" But having the family at the heart of the story speak Korean at home added nuance and complexity to movie, Chung said.\"That adds, I feel, a layer of what this family's actually going through and that sort of insular feeling that you have when the reality at home is different from the one outside,\" he said, \"and that you really try to preserve some of that reality within your own family as you feel it slipping away.\" Why the Golden Globes nomination sparked controversyIn recent months, controversy erupted over the Golden Globes' rules, which made \"Minari\" eligible for best foreign-language film but not best picture because more than 50% of the movie is not in English.That's raised serious questions about racism in Hollywood and calls for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to reexamine its language requirements.\"It feels personal. ... It feels like the 'where are you from?' question that Asian Americans always get,\" says Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and author of \"Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism\" told CNN. \"The assumption is that if you have an Asian face, you must not be from here.\"The United States has no official language.

Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung (right) with actors Steven Yeun (left) and Will Patton (center) on the set of \"Minari.\"The movie gets its title from the Korean name for a resilient herb. But there's no doubt that the vivid, richly textured scenes of the film tell a decidedly American tale -- from pastoral Ozark landscapes to country church pews to the Yi family's home.\"Minari\" swept top prizes at Sundance last year. It's also winning rave reviews from people whose communities it depicts -- immigrants and non-immigrants alike. An Arkansas Times journalist recently called it \"the most authentic coming-of-age story I've seen reflected on screen about our part of the world.\"Chung says he credits Pulitzer-winning novelist Willa Cather -- who chronicled life on the American Plains more than a century ago -- for inspiring him to tell it. About her books \"O Pioneers!\" and \"My Antonia,\" Cather once said she had written stories inspired by her own upbringing after years of imitating cosmopolitan authors in New York. \"She wrote that her work really took off when she stopped admiring and she started remembering,\" Chung told CNN. \"And that's what got me to sit down finally and just write out my memories. And that became the kernel of a film.\" Why the film's Golden Globe nomination struck a nerveThe memories Chung weaves together in \"Minari\" are something many Americans who grew up in immigrant families can relate to: The joy of a visiting family member bringing spices from home, the struggles of different generations to connect, the pent-up emotions of parents risking everything to support their family, the faces of children who are trying to fit in.Grandson David (Alan S. Kim) and grandmother Soonja (Yuh-Jung Youn) have a rocky relationship in \"Minari.\"To Yuen, it feels momentous.\"A lot of us are seeing our stories on screen for the first time,\" she says.So when news first broke that the Golden Globes' eligibility rules would force \"Minari\" to compete in the \"best foreign-language film\" category, it stung.Actor Daniel Dae Kim and other Asian celebrities swiftly took to social media to share their dismay. Kim described it as \"the film equivalent of being told to go back to your country when that country is actually America.\"For some, it was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to the previous year, when Lulu Wang's 2019 film \"The Farewell\" was shut out of the award ceremony's best comedy race because much of the movie was in Mandarin Chinese.\"It's great these films are being made, but it's terrible that they're being put in the foreign language categories,\" Yuen says. \"We shouldn't be punished for telling different American stories that haven't been told before.\"And it's particularly troubling, Yuen says, at a time when Asian Americans are increasingly facing verbal and physical attacks.\"When you call 'Minari' a foreign film, it doesn't help the kind of general anti-Asian sentiment, the perpetual foreigner stereotype that Asian Americans are dealing with, not just in an abstract representational way, but in a lived experience, under attack by our government and individuals.\"What the awards' rules sayThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association's rules for the Golden Globes state that only films with 50% or more of their dialog in English are eligible to compete in the awards' best motion picture categories.Other awards use different criteria. The Oscars, for example, allow films in any language to compete for best picture. And last year \"Parasite,\" a Korean-language film set in Seoul, became the first non-English film to win the award.The Golden Globes' rules aren't new. But some are arguing it's long past time for the association to reevaluate the criteria it uses for its prestigious prizes.FYI: English isn't the official language of the United StatesCharlene Jimenez, director of entertainment partnerships and advocacy for the nonprofit Define American, described this year's Golden Globes nominations as part of a \"pattern of erasure\" as she recently called for a review of the language requirement.\"More than 350 languages are spoken in American homes today. So what does 'foreign' language mean?\" Jimenez told CNN. \"It's a really important time for us as an American society to be investigating our own prejudice about films like this, about stories like this, about immigrant stories -- what does and does not resonate as 'American' to people.\"The United States has no official language. And more than 20% of the US population age 5 and over speaks a language other than English at home, according to census data.If the Golden Globes' rules don't change with the times, there could be consequences beyond the big screen, says William Yu, a screenwriter and activist who's been a vocal critic of whitewashing in Hollywood.JUST WATCHED2016: Why is this actor being photoshopped on movie posters?

", "full_article_text": "This story contains spoilers for \"Encanto,\" which is currently in theaters and streaming on Disney+. (CNN)Kadesha Adelakun bought toys from \"Encanto\" before she even had a chance to see the movie. She knew characters from a multiracial Afro-Latino family would be an important addition to her office in Kennesaw, Georgia, where she holds play therapy sessions and makes a point of finding toys that reflect the diversity of her young patients' lives.When she finally watched the movie on Disney+, Adelakun realized the figurines were an even better fit than she'd imagined. The plot of \"Encanto,\" she says, perfectly captures issues many families are going through. \"There are so many layers, so many dynamics,\" Adelakun says.While catchy songs from \"Encanto\" are topping the charts, Disney's latest animated film is drawing praise from therapists like Adelakun for another reason: the way the movie portrays trauma and healing. Read MoreTherapists who spoke with CNN say they're talking about the movie with their clients -- many of whom are first-generation children of immigrants who see themselves reflected in the story, hear their experiences in the soundtrack, and are using \"Encanto\" to speak out about things that otherwise might go unsaid.\"I think it's going to have a great impact on society. ... People are seeing this movie and they're realizing they're seeing themselves in it,\" Adelakun says.Here's a look at several key \"Encanto\" characters and the conversations they're sparking:The healer trying to keep her family wholeThe character: MirabelThe song that stands out: \"Waiting On a Miracle\"What therapists are hearing:At the beginning of \"Encanto,\" Mirabel introduces us to the Madrigal family, gleefully describing each person's \"gift,\" or magical power. We later learn that the magic and the family's enchanted house have a darker side, originating in a traumatic moment after the family was forced to flee their home, trudge through the wilderness and cross a river seeking safety. Mirabel is the only member of the Madrigal family who doesn't get a gift. But in the end, her power is in seeing her family members for who they are and doing all she can to keep them together.\"Mirabel was really the glue to the family, but no one was really seeing it,\" Adelakun says.And it's no coincidence that her character is someone many can identify with, says Mara Sammartino, a therapist in Fairfield, California.\"Our parents come here fleeing war, poverty, violence. They come here, they establish a life, and then we're born into this duality, and we're not seen in one, and we're not seen in the other. I think that's why Mirabel's character resonates,\" says Sammartino, whose parents came to the United States from Nicaragua. \"She is part of that duality. She's the only one that's in touch with the community. ... She's the only one that's (leaving the house) and going out, talking to people. Then she comes back home and she's kind of put in her place and told, 'you actually don't have anything to contribute.'\" Jenny Lemus, a psychotherapist in Chicago, says she heard feelings many of her clients have expressed for years in Mirabel's song, \"Waiting on a Miracle.\"\"She's trying to communicate with her grandmother -- 'Look, this is what I'm experiencing. I want to be seen.' A lot of times, the younger generations, what I've seen over the years, they want to be seen (by their families), they want the acknowledgment at least, and they're not getting it,\" Lemus says.The perfectionist who feels she can't failThe character: IsabelaThe song that stands out: \"What Else Can I Do?\"What therapists are hearing:At first glance, Isabela looks like she has it all; she can make flowers out of thin air and tosses her long hair like she doesn't have a care in the world. But her song reveals how limiting perfectionism can be.Adelakun, whose parents came to the US from Trinidad and Tobago, says the message is relatable for many immigrants' children -- including her.\"In my family, one of the main things is about not letting your family down ... especially when you know they've made sacrifices to come to this country, to send you to good schools, to live in certain neighborhoods, just the importance of not letting your family down and trying to hold up to their expectations,\" she says.First-generation children constantly \"get the message that we need to be more,\" says Lemus, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Guatemala. And those pressures, she says, can take a major toll.\"There's a lot of anger. Sometimes we don't know where the anger comes from. Why do I feel so angry with my parents or grandparents? What's going on?... You see that a lot with first-generation Latinos, a lot of resentment building up because of that pressure that is unspoken within the family dynamic,\" Lemus says. \"'Encanto' had such a beautiful way of portraying that in subtle ways. ... Those of us that saw the movie and related to it, we got the message. We related so much to it. And I think that's why it's been such a hit.\"The sibling carrying the weight of her family on her shouldersThe character: LuisaThe song that stands out: \"Surface Pressure\"What therapists are hearing:Big-muscled Luisa is used to carrying anything her family needs her to handle. And her song confessing that she's about to crack under the weight of it all is resonating with many people.\"It describes what anxiety feels like perfectly,\" says Lemus, whose patients are predominately first-generation Latinos.\"A lot of clients relate to Luisa, who is experiencing the pressure of ... carrying the burden for their younger siblings ... having that pressure (of) protecting the younger siblings from their own experiences. It is eye-opening, and I'm so glad that I have clients that are very insightful and can relate to it.\"Seeing Luisa's struggle depicted on screen can help those who are dealing with similar difficulties better understand and describe their own situation, Sammartino says.\"I think 'Encanto' gives a little bit of space for some clients. They can say, 'Oh, well, look at Luisa.' They're not going to say, 'Well, that's me.' They say, 'Luisa experiences that. I feel for Luisa.'\"The family secret that goes unspokenThe character: BrunoThe song that stands out: \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\"What therapists are hearing: When it comes to Bruno, who's ostracized by his family and ends up hiding in the walls of the Madrigal house so he can be nearby but not have to face them, there's plenty to talk about.Bruno's gift is seeing the future, and his family members blame him when the prophecies come true. Some of his mannerisms have sparked speculation about other possible diagnoses for the character, who's the focus of the movie's most popular song. \"He thinks differently. He sees things differently,\" Adelakun says. \"We have family members who are also neurodivergent or have mental health issues, and because they're different, they get shunned, or they're not spoken about.\" Family secrets like the stories that come out when Bruno is discussed in the film are a common sign of the intergenerational trauma many first-generation families deal with, Lemus says.\"We don't talk about feelings. We don't talk about emotions. We don't talk about trauma. It's so taboo to bring it up, and it's uncomfortable to even express ourselves,\" says Lemus, who says she tries to work with patients to help them learn how to better communicate those feelings.\"But also, she says, \"without the expectation that it's going to be taken the way we expect it to be. Because...we don't know how our parents or grandparents are going to take those hard conversations. ... Generation from generation, if you didn't learn how to express your emotions, you're not going to know how to communicate in a healthy way.\" The matriarch who passes down her traumaThe character: AbuelaThe song that stands out: \"Dos Oruguitas\" (played in the background during a flashback showing the traumatic origins of the Madrigal family's powers)What therapists are hearing: Protecting her family and their enchanted home is Abuela's top priority. She's obsessed with maintaining their magical powers and fails to realize how her experiences as a young mother -- fleeing her home and losing her husband -- have shaped her and her family. It's only when the house crumbles and she almost loses everything that she sees her role in fracturing the family.For Sammartino, it's a perfect example to point to when she's trying to help her clients empathize with their elders.\"My way of trying to support my clients is to really develop a lens of empathy for their parents and the trauma that they experienced,\" Sammartino says. \"Like Abuela in the movie, her husband was murdered in front of her. Why wouldn't she be overprotective?\"It's a classic illustration of intergenerational trauma, Adelakun says -- and something that's likely to increasingly resonate as the film gets a wider audience.\"As more people see this movie, or as more people talk about it, I think you're probably going to see more people realizing they have repressed these things. I wonder how many people we're going to see say, 'I didn't realize, or I forgot, but I had those same experiences, too,' or, 'I didn't realize I was doing that to my family members.' Abuela didn't realize she was doing all this to harm her family,\" Adelakun says.In the movie, Abuela apologizes once she realizes the harm she's caused.But Lemus cautions there's one thing that's important to remember.In real life, she says, Disney endings are rare. \"We don't see that outcome often. When we do see it, when we see the Mirabels of the world making changes for their family and making changes for themselves, it's so beautiful,\" she says. \"It's also beautiful when they do the work and when they realize they need to set boundaries in their families.\"Sometimes, families become estranged rather than coming together with a shared understanding. It's a sad outcome, Lemus says, but doesn't stop individuals from coming to terms with trauma and giving a healthy start to future generations.Even without a Disney ending, she says, it's possible to heal."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2021", "month": "12", "day": "11"}, "text": {"headline": "entertainment", "text": "Many Puerto Ricans felt insulted by the way characters from the island were portrayed in the 1961 version of \"West Side Story.\" Here's how Steven Spielberg's remake responds to some of the missteps of the original film.", "full_article_text": " (CNN)The \"West Side Story\" in theaters now isn't the movie you've seen before -- and that's a good thing. The original 1961 film won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture. But for decades this retelling of \"Romeo and Juliet\" through the lens of White and Puerto Rican gangs in New York has been panned by Puerto Ricans who felt insulted by the way characters from the island were portrayed. Some worried Steven Spielberg's remake of the classic musical would repeat -- and amplify -- the very same one-sided story that's cast a stereotypical shadow over generations of Puerto Ricans. Spielberg vowed not to do that. And it's clear he and his team took past criticisms into account as they shaped their version. Award-winning playwright Tony Kushner significantly rewrote much of the screenplay, using Arthur Laurents' book for the 1957 Broadway show as a jumping-off point.The songs are largely the same, but the story is different in several notable ways -- especially when it comes to the movie's Puerto Rican characters.Read MoreHere's a look at how the new \"West Side Story\" responds to some of the missteps of the original film.How Spielberg tried to solve the problem of MariaNatalie Wood played Maria in the 1961 film, with Marni Nixon's voice dubbed in for all the heroine's songs. Neither one of them was Puerto Rican, or even Latina; most of the movie's cast wasn't, either. Spielberg's version casts Colombian American Rachel Zegler as Maria. And all the other Puerto Rican characters are played by Latino actors, too. \"It's so important for people like us to see people like us onscreen,\" Zegler said in a recent \"20/20\" special on the film, \"to see people like us singing 'I Feel Pretty,' to see people like us falling in love and feeling joy and dancing around in pretty dresses. It's so important for that next generation to see someone that looks like them.\"Natalie Wood, left, played Maria in the original film of \"West Side Story.\" Rachel Zegler, right, plays her in the new movie.Zegler's been getting rave reviews for her performance. Still, not everyone is sold on the casting choice.\"I have an issue with Hollywood once again fumbling the easiest of opportunities to elevate a Puerto Rican actress. They seem to think that as long as the actors are Hispanic, that's enough,\" Daily Beast Assistant Managing Editor Mandy Velez wrote in a recent column. \"Except it's not, to me or to other Puerto Ricans so thirsty to see themselves represented on screen they might collapse from dehydration.\" There's no one wearing brownface in this movieIn the original \"West Side Story,\" many of the actors playing Puerto Rican characters were forced to wear the same dark brown makeup -- even Rita Moreno, who is Puerto Rican and played the character of Anita.\"I remember saying to the makeup man one day \u2015 because it was like putting mud on my face, it was really dark and I'm a fairly fair Hispanic \u2015 and I said to the makeup man one day 'My God! Why do we all have to be the same color?\" Moreno told Futuro Media's \"In the Thick\" podcast in 2017. \"Puerto Ricans are French and Spanish...' And it's true, we are very many different colors, we're Taino indian, we are Black some of us.\"When she raised that point on set, Moreno said she got a surprising response.\"The makeup man actually said to me, 'What? Are you a racist?' I was so flabbergasted that I couldn't come back with an answer.\"In the original \"West Side Story\" movie, Rita Moreno and other actors were forced to wear brownface. In Spielberg's version, Moreno is back in a new role, without the offensive makeup.Thankfully, no one in the 2021 film is wearing brownface. A diverse cast of actors are playing Puerto Rican characters, including Ariana DeBose, who's Afro-Latina and plays Anita. And this time around, Moreno's observations weren't dismissed. She plays a new character written for this version, Valentina. She was an executive producer of the movie. And she regularly spoke with the cast about what it was like growing up as a Puerto Rican in America.\"She brought so many interesting stories, and she so motivated the cast,\" Spielberg says in a promotional video for the film. \"And I thought she really needed to be the executive producer, more of a managerial role, not just to come in as an actor, but to really help us frame the messages that 'West Side Story' needs to extend to people who see it. She's been very, very causal in all of that.\"The words to an iconic song have changedFor many fans, \"America\" is one of the most beloved and well-known songs from \"West Side Story.\" The rousing dance number is also a searing debate between Anita and her boyfriend Bernardo over the costs and benefits of migration to the US mainland. But many of the lyrics sung by Anita painted Puerto Rico in a negative light, in both the 1957 musical (\"island of tropical diseases\") and the 1961 movie (\"let it sink back in the ocean\").That drew criticism when Spielberg and Kushner traveled to the University of Puerto Rico in 2018 to meet with students and faculty for input while they were making the new movie. In the 1961 film, Rita Moreno's Anita sang that she wanted Puerto Rico to \"sink back in the ocean.\" In the new movie, Ariana DeBose's Anita isn't as hostile toward Puerto Rico in the version of the song she sings. There, a professor of theater history and acting pointed out the song's problematic lyrics as she questioned how Spielberg and Kushner planned to represent Puerto Ricans in the film. Kushner told the audience that the White, Jewish team behind the original story likely assumed the migration experience for Puerto Ricans was the same as it had been for their ancestors, who looked on the Old Country with disdain. The professor who'd raised concerns later told The Hollywood Reporter that it doesn't make sense for a Puerto Rican character to be speaking so disparagingly of the island, when most people migrate out of economic necessity and desperation.\"No one leaves this island without sobbing,\" Isel Rodriguez said. \"Three hundred thousand people left the island after Maria and the scene at the airport was like a funeral.\"In the end, Spielberg's version of \"America\" cuts the song's most controversial lines. There's no one wishing an island where millions of people live should sink into the ocean. By paring down the lyrics, the new version sharpens the focus of the song to the debate over whether life on the US mainland is good or bad for Puerto Ricans, rather than dragging Puerto Rico and its people through the mud. The Sharks finally get backstoriesBroadway composer and lyricist Lin Manuel-Miranda, whose parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico, has said that for Latinos, \"West Side Story\" has been \"our greatest blessing and our greatest curse.\"\"As a piece of art, I think it's just about as good as it gets,\" Miranda told The Washington Post in 2009. \"It also represented our foot in the door as an artistic community on Broadway. ... At the same time, because it's just about the only representation of Latinos on Broadway and it's about gangs, that's where it gets tricky.\"In the original movie, the Caucasian Jets also get a lot more screen time than the Sharks, their Puerto Rican rivals. In this version, the Sharks are still gang members, but we finally get a chance to learn more about some of them.Little was written about George Chakiris' Bernardo and the rest of the Sharks' lives in the 1961 film. In the 2021 remake, David Alvarez's Bernardo is a boxer, and more details are included about some of the movie's other Puerto Rican characters.Tony Kushner's screenplay creates back stories for Puerto Rican characters that in the original were two-dimensional at best, and stereotypical at worst.In the 2021 film, Chino is going to school to be an accountant. Bernardo is a boxer who came to New York more recently. Anita is a seamstress who's saving money because she wants to open her own dress shop someday. Maria and her friends work on a cleaning crew at Gimbels department store. Valentina, the new character written for this movie, is a widow running her store and trying to navigate life between two cultures. And everyone who lives in their neighborhood -- Sharks and Jets alike -- is about to get evicted so wrecking balls can tear down their homes to make way for the construction of Lincoln Center.Spanish is spoken much more -- and with a Puerto Rican accentA few Spanish phrases were sprinkled into the original \"West Side Story\" -- often delivered with accents that sounded more like Americans overacting than the way Puerto Ricans living in New York actually speak. The Spanish in Spielberg's film is delivered with trademark Puerto Rican phrases and accents. It's spoken -- without any subtitles -- in intimate scenes like conversations between Maria and Anita at home. In the 2021 version of \"West Side Story,\" Maria and Anita speak Spanish in some of their most intimate conversations, like the scene where Anita is fitting Maria's new dress.And the only time it sounds stilted makes sense in the story -- when non-native speakers like Tony, Maria's Polish-American love interest, are trying to say something in Spanish.In fact, the very first song with lyrics that we hear in the remake is sung in Spanish. It's the Sharks' version of the Puerto Rican anthem \"La Borinque\u00f1a,\" performed after police order them to leave a crime scene. And it wasn't in the original.The team behind this movie tried to do their homeworkOriginally, the plot of \"West Side Story\" was conceived to focus on tensions between Jews and Catholics on Manhattan's Lower East Side. After they shifted gears to make Puerto Ricans one of the rival gangs, it's clear the musical's creators did little to research the Puerto Rican experience. Stephen Sondheim even admitted that he had never even met a Puerto Rican when he took on the assignment.Director Steven Spielberg and Rita Moreno as Valentina on the set of 20th Century Studios' \"West Side Story.\"Spielberg and Kushner took a different tack, spending time researching Puerto Rican communities that lived in New York in 1957, when the musical is set. The visit to the University of Puerto Rico was one of many conversations.Kushner has said the team behind the film also met with history experts and worked with native speakers -- including dancers and actors in the cast -- to make sure the Spanish phrases were written and used correctly.JUST WATCHEDPlaywright Tony Kushner on working with SpielbergReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPlaywright Tony Kushner on working with Spielberg 23:32\"We kept working on this thing, because there was such an enormous feeling that \u2014 it wasn't like, 'Oh god, we're going to get canceled if somebody says the wrong word' \u2014 but this deep desire to get it right and true,\" Kushner told TIME this week.So far that attention to detail and the changes to the plot seem to be winning over critics, who've responded enthusiastically to the remake.

Londoner Marc Hayes recalled a story about the actor, who was best known for his portrayal of James Bond in the '70s and '80s, on Facebook. The post is a poignant reminder of why we idolize television and movie stars.Read it below:Was Roger Moore the best Bond ever? Well...As an seven year old in about 1983, in the days before First Class Lounges at airports, I was with my grandad in Nice Airport and saw Roger Moore sitting at the departure gate, reading a paper. I told my granddad I'd just seen James Bond and asked if we could go over so I could get his autograph. My grandad had no idea who James Bond or Roger Moore were, so we walked over and he popped me in front of Roger Moore, with the words \"my grandson says you're famous. Can you sign this?\"As charming as you'd expect, Roger asks my name and duly signs the back of my plane ticket, a fulsome note full of best wishes. I'm ecstatic, but as we head back to our seats, I glance down at the signature. It's hard to decipher it but it definitely doesn't say 'James Bond'. My grandad looks at it, half figures out it says 'Roger Moore' - I have absolutely no idea who that is, and my hearts sinks. I tell my grandad he's signed it wrong, that he's put someone else's name - so my grandad heads back to Roger Moore, holding the ticket which he's only just signed.Roger Moore ensured James Bond's cinematic survivalI remember staying by our seats and my grandad saying \"he says you've signed the wrong name. He says your name is James Bond.\" Roger Moore's face crinkled up with realisation and he beckoned me over. When I was by his knee, he leant over, looked from side to side, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said to me, \"I have to sign my name as 'Roger Moore' because otherwise...Blofeld might find out I was here.\" He asked me not to tell anyone that I'd just seen James Bond, and he thanked me for keeping his secret. I went back to our seats, my nerves absolutely jangling with delight. My grandad asked me if he'd signed 'James Bond.' No, I said. I'd got it wrong. I was working with James Bond now.

Weinstein's strength, says Nathan, lies in his ability to catch a \"middle-brow\" film right before it becomes popular and turn it into the frontrunner.Nathan told CNN: \"He's very good at picking the middle-brow films... and the Oscars are a mainstream event which celebrates the best of the middle. Harvey's been a very wily player in that, and you have to give him that credit, he knows how to map that out over a year.\" While \"The Artist\" has punched above its weight at the box office, tallying roughly $76 million in worldwide receipts so far (58% from outside the U.S.), the film didn't receive much of a box office bump following the announcement of Oscar nominations in January, according to Ian Nathan -- especially compared with \"The King's Speech,\" which raked in an estimated $415 million worldwide (66% from international)  on its way to winning best picture, actor and director at the 2011 Academy Awards.\"It hasn't made the usual Oscar success money that the 'The King's Speech' did last year,\" said Nathan. \"It's a silent film with a French sensibility, and it's a tougher sell for audiences. But now that it's got all the attention in the world, can that translate to more money?\"While the money may not follow, Nathan says one thing seems certain -- after a relatively dry decade, the back-to-back successes of \"The King's Speech\" and \"The Artist\" means Harvey Weinstein is back in business. \"Harvey's come out of his fallow years as the guy to beat at the Oscars,\" he said. \"It's a bit of a second coming -- clearly he's still got a little bit of that magic.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2012", "month": "7", "day": "27"}, "text": {"headline": "europe", "text": "Danny Boyle has brought  zombies and  junkies to the big screen, but has just faced the toughest task of his career: the Olympics Opening Ceremony.", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsDanny Boyle is the mastermind behind the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremonyBoyle is best known for hit movies \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" \"28 Days Later\" and \"Trainspotting\"Despite the films' black humor, director insists his work is positive, life-affirmingCeremony tipped as \"expression of welcome,\" celebration of BritishnessHe's brought bloodthirsty zombies, squalid junkies and murderous housemates to life on the big screen, but faced the toughest task of his career at London 2012: bringing boogying nurses, bucolic scenes and butterflies on bicycles to a worldwide audience of a billion people.Danny Boyle, the Oscar-winning director -- and east London resident -- best known for hit movies \"Trainspotting\" and \"Slumdog Millionaire\" was the man responsible for the Olympic opening ceremony, the show that televisions around the world were tuned in to at the start of London's long-awaited Games.And while those of his films set in Britain have painted a darkly comic picture of the country, \"Isles of Wonder\" -- the \"Tempest\"-inspired extravaganza which kicked off the Games -- proved much more of a celebration of the nation.Live blog: Let the games beginA billion people across the globe tuned in for the three-hour, $42.4m show, which featured 10,000 adult volunteers, 900 children, 12 horses, 10 chickens, nine geese, three cows and a flock of sheep.With an uplifting, \"people power\" theme combining references to British history and pop culture, the rambunctious ceremony covered subjects as diverse as the Industrial Revolution, the National Health Service, popular children's book characters including Peter Pan and Mary Poppins, and pop stars past and present. It was well received in the United Kingdom and abroad, drawing an average audience of 40.7 million people in the US, topping the previous record of 39.8 million for the 1996 Atlanta Games.\"The Ceremony is an attempt to capture a picture of ourselves as a nation, where we have come from and where we want to be,\" Boyle explained in a statement in the run-up to the Games, saying he hoped to tell the country's story, with the help of a vast army of volunteers who, he said, \"are the purest embodiment of the Olympic spirit and represent the best of who we are as a nation.\"\"We have to celebrate all that is great about the past but also all the potential Britain has in the future,\" said British Prime Minister David Cameron. \"The difficulty is how do you cram in all that is great about our country, whether it is sport, art, literature, history, contribution to world events. I'm confident they have done a good job and there were one or two moments I was really moved by. There's something for everyone.\"Opinion: Is Team USA's militaristic uniform a problem?Britons are known for their ability to laugh at themselves, and it appears Boyle sought to capitalize on this -- as The Economist noted recently, \"opening ceremonies are a country's opportunity to sell itself to the world. Britain appears to be selling irony.\"Olympics organizers say that Boyle's experience, energy and unusual vision made him the perfect man for the job.\"His ability as a storyteller, as a creator of spectacle, his background in both theater and film and the passion he has for this city and this project -- they all just screamed at us,\" said Bill Morris, director of Ceremonies for the London Games, when Boyle was appointed to the role. \"It wasn't a difficult choice.\"\"Danny gets this,\" London 2012 Chairman Sebastian Coe told CNN back in 2010. \"He gets the Olympic Games, he gets sports, he lives in London, he's a stone's throw from the Olympic Park, and it was just such an obvious fit.\"It was not always thus: Boyle, 55, was born into a working-class family in Manchester, northern England, the son of a power plant worker and a cafeteria employee, and as a child had hoped to become a Catholic priest.But after a school trip to see a much-lauded Royal Shakespeare Company performance of \"Richard II,\" and a visit to the cinema with classmates to see Stanley Kubrick's controversial \"A Clockwork Orange,\" his ambitions turned instead to film and theater.Boyle studied English and drama at university, before working at the RSC and at London's innovative Royal Court Theatre, where he was deputy director in the 1980s. He moved into television, and then on to movies, making his big screen debut with \"Shallow Grave,\" the darkly humorous tale of three flatmates who discover a suitcase full of cash when their new lodger dies of a drug overdose.JUST WATCHEDEnglish doctor who inspired the GamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEnglish doctor who inspired the Games 04:44JUST WATCHEDA visitor's guide to London ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA visitor's guide to London  02:00JUST WATCHEDBritish etiquette for London GamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBritish etiquette for London Games 02:03JUST WATCHEDOlympic park transforms London's East EndReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOlympic park transforms London's East End 03:56Despite being made on a shoestring budget -- Boyle is reported to have said the team behind it were forced to sell off furniture to buy film stock when the $1.55m budget began to run short -- \"Shallow Grave\" became Britain's biggest grossing film of 1995, earning $20m worldwide, as well as a string of positive reviews.He followed it up with \"Trainspotting\" (1996) the critically-acclaimed story of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts, which launched the careers of Ewan McGregor, Kelly Macdonald (\"Boardwalk Empire\") and Kevin McKidd (\"Grey's Anatomy\"), and was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as \"a visionary knockout spiked with insight, wild invention and outrageous wit.\" London welcomes world for Olympics opening ceremonyIts success -- the movie, which had cost just $2m to make, earned $72m -- prompted a move towards Hollywood, but Boyle's career faltered with his first two big-budget projects, \"A Life Less Ordinary,\" and \"The Beach,\" and he briefly returned to television in the UK, before making his movie comeback with 2002's post-apocalyptic zombie flick \"28 Days Later.\"He then changed tone, directing the more family-orientated family feature \"Millions,\" (2004) about two brothers who find a stash of pound notes only days before the UK is set to switch its currency to the euro.Five years later, he scooped the Oscar for Best Director when \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" the story of a poor Indian teenager who wins a TV gameshow, swept the board at the 2009 Academy Awards.And it is the uplifting, life-affirming mood of \"Slumdog Millionaire\" that the director brought to the opening ceremony, because despite the dark subject matter of many of his films, and his recent return to theater with a rapturously-received production of Frankenstein, Boyle insists he remains positive, an optimist.Speaking in 2010, he said: \"I want it to feel like a very genuine expression of the welcome to the athletes and to the Games of the city, and especially from east London.\"As the athletes launch into competition in venues around his home, his ceremony's combination of novelty, national pride and nuttiness seems to have accomplished exactly that.Complete coverage: The 2012 Olympic GamesPhotos: Olympian outtakesBlind archer posts first world record of London Olympics"}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2012", "month": "7", "day": "6"}, "text": {"headline": "europe", "text": "For 50 years one spy has outfoxed, outgunned, and outdressed every villain thrown his way.

A blue plaque marks the site of Hitchcock's birthplace and childhood home.Sadly, little trace remains of his early life there: His birthplace, at 517 Leytonstone High Road, was demolished many years ago to make way for a gas station and fast food outlet, though eagle-eyed visitors may notice a plaque on the spot. Hitchcock knocks Welles off top film listAs a young boy, an unknowing Hitchcock was sent to the local police station with a note asking the officer on duty to lock him in a cell briefly to warn him what happened to people who misbehaved. Unfortunately, the police station too has been knocked down, but information boards at the site retell the story.

For the rest of his life, he would use London as the setting for many of his films: Some of the city's most famous landmarks serve as backdrops to the action.\"London was his base, even after he had moved to the U.S. and was working in Hollywood. It was the location for many of his films, and it was the subtext that ran through them,\" said Sandra Shevey, who runs a regular walking tour of Hitchcock's London film locations.

The museum, which opened in 1875, is home to a grisly selection of criminal evidence from notorious cases including those of Jack the Ripper and Dr Crippen. It is no longer open to the public, instead being used for police and forensic science training.Tourist hotspotsAnother museum played a more direct role in Hitchcock's final silent film -- and first 'talkie' -- \"Blackmail\" (1929). The movie's climactic chase scene takes place across the domed glass roof of the British Museum's old reading room.\"Blackmail\" is one of Morris's top picks for film fans on the lookout for London links to Hitchcock: Other scenes take place in Trafalgar Square, Whitehall and Lower Regent Street.Morris also highlights 1936's \"Sabotage,\" one of the final movies Hitch made before moving to the U.S. in 1939.Battersea Power Station provides the opening backdrop for \"Sabotage.\"Opening at the then-newly-built Battersea Power Station (now little more than a shell of a building), the film is a filmic feast of the city's tourist hotspots: Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus and London Zoo all feature, alongside one of the director's favorite restaurants, Simpson's-in-the-Strand.The interior shots of Simpson's were filmed in the studio. Sadly, as with many of the locations linked to the director's life, these have since been demolished, but at the site of the former Gainsborough Studios in Islington -- now transformed into an apartment complex -- a huge sculpture of Hitchcock's head (by artist Antony Donaldson) commemorates his time there.Even after he had left the UK, Hitchcock frequently returned to London to film. Interestingly, Morris points out that he was not actually present when one of the most memorable London scenes in his work was captured on film: The assassin's fatal fall from the belltower of Westminster Cathedral in \"Foreign Correspondent.\"\"Deaths from a height are such an important Hitchcockian motif, but because the war was on, Hitchcock could not come to London, and so it was filmed by a second unit,\" she said.Hitchcock: The man behind the moviesThe byzantine-style Catholic cathedral would also play another role in Hitchcock's life, some four decades later: It was the location of a memorial service for the director, following his death in 1980.Alfred Hitchcock buys a copy of the Evening Standard with a chilling headline.For Shevey, Hitchcock's key London films are \"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\" \"The Parradine Case,\" and \"Frenzy,\" all of which, she says, feature \"some of the most beautiful buildings in London,\" from Portland Place and the Royal Albert Hall to Tower Bridge and Covent Garden Market.\"Frenzy\" in particular is rooted in its London location, the old fruit and vegetable market and the streets and pubs nearby: The Globe, in Bow Street, and the Nell of Old Drury in Catherine Street. It would be his last movie made in the city\"'Frenzy' was his homecoming film,\" Morris told CNN. \"It brings him full circle, back to the London of 'The Lodger.'\"Next stepsIf all this has wetted your appetite, then head to the BFI Southbank, which is currently showing an entire \"Genius of Hitchcock\" season featuring all of the director's surviving movies, including those early silent films.The BFI's Mediatheque also offers the chance to view interviews, rarely-seen clips and other material linked to Leytonstone's most famous son.You can also join an organized tour of Hitchcock's London.

It's the ultimate love story.\"And that, it would seem, is... a truth universally acknowledged.In Jane Austen's footsteps: Discover novelist's EnglandCNN's Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report."}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2013", "month": "1", "day": "28"}, "text": {"headline": "europe", "text": "Jane Austen is one of England's best-loved writers; celebrate the 200th anniversary of Pride and Prejudice, with a tour of key locations from her life and work.", "full_article_text": "Story highlightsJane Austen is one of the English language's best-known and most-loved writers Her most popular book, \"Pride and Prejudice\" is celebrating its 200th anniversary in 2013Join the festivities by taking a tour of some of the key locations in her life and worksShare your memories and suggestions for further trips in the comments belowJane Austen is one of the English language's best-known and most-loved writers. Celebrate the 200th anniversary of her most popular book, \"Pride and Prejudice,\" with a tour of some of the key locations in her life and works -- and in the big-screen adaptations they inspired.Film and TV locationsThe location every \"Pride and Prejudice\" fan wants to visit is, of course, Pemberley -- \"a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills,\" as Austen describes it.Just where to look for the house and grounds (and whether you're also looking for that all important lake, of course) depends which adaptation you favor: The 1995 TV version was filmed at Lyme Park in Cheshire (exterior scenes), and Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire (interior scenes).For many readers and viewers, the house which best corresponds to the Pemberley of their imagination is Chatsworth, in Derbyshire.Pride and Prejudice turns 200In the 2005 film, it is Chatsworth Keira Knightley that is referring to when she jokes that her love for Darcy dates from her \"first seeing his grounds at Pemberley,\" but Austen expert Janet Todd, of Cambridge University's Lucy Cavendish College, says this is a mistake. \"The great houses we see in the TV and film versions of 'Pride and Prejudice' are too great,\" she insists, arguing that by imagining the action of Jane Austen's novels taking place in such grand houses, we change their tone. \"Darcy is not the Duke of Devonshire [the owner of Chatsworth]; the owner of Chatsworth would not be seen at the Meryton Ball. Austen's stories are those of the middle class, the gentry, and not the upper class, the aristocracy.\"Other locations to feature in the 2005 film include Burgley, and the village of Stamford in Lincolnshire; Haddon Hall in Derbyshire (which also features in three versions of \"Jane Eyre,\" \"The Princess Bride\" and \"The Other Boleyn Girl\"); and Groombridge Place in Kent (which also has links to Arthur Conan Doyle, and Sherlock Holmes) which doubles for the Bennets' home, Longbourn. In the 1995 adaptation, the village of Lacock in Wiltshire stands in for Meryton, while nearby Luckington Court, in the Cotswolds, plays the part of Longbourn; scenes at Rosings, the imposing stately home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, were shot at Belton House in Lincolnshire.BathBath is the city perhaps most closely associated with Jane Austen; it features prominently in two of her novels ('Northanger Abbey' and 'Persuasion'), and she lived here with her family from 1801 to 1806. In the Georgian era, it was a fashionable spa town, where the well-to-do came to 'take the waters' -- and to see and be seen, at the Assembly Rooms, the Pump Room, and the theater.Today, much of the city's Georgian architecture remains, making it almost as popular with film and TV crews making costume dramas as it is with tourists.Austen fans can visit the Jane Austen Centre, take the waters -- and then take their taste away with tea at the Pump Room -- and wander the streets that the novelist herself walked down: Royal Crescent, The Circus, Gay Street, Queen Square and Sydney Place, where Austen lived at Number 4.\"Parts of the city look the same as they did in Jane Austen's day,\" explains David Lassman, of the Jane Austen Centre, \"So visitors can see the same buildings she saw, get a sense of what it was like in her day, and walk in her footsteps.\"VisitBath, the local tourism office, offers a free audio tour, \"In the footsteps of Jane Austen\" and there is also a Jane Austen Tour of Bath iPhone app, guiding visitors around the city using photos, paintings, Regency music and quotes from her work and letters.HampshireJane Austen was born and brought up in the Hampshire village of Steventon, where her father was the local vicar. Her birthplace, the rectory, no longer exists, but there are several memorials to Austen in St Nicholas' Church, including a weathervane in the shape of a pen.Austen spent the last eight years of her life at Chawton, and it was here, in the red brick cottage where she lived with her mother and sister that she revised her earlier works for publication, and wrote \"Mansfield Park,\" \"Emma\" and \"Persuasion.\"The cottage is now a museum of Austen's life and work, home to family portraits, manuscripts, and the table at which she wrote some of her most famous work.In 1817, Austen became ill, and was persuaded to travel to Winchester to be close to her doctor; she stayed in a house in College Street (now marked with a plaque), and died there on July 18, 1817, aged 41. She was buried in the north aisle of Winchester Cathedral; her gravestone makes no mention of her career as a writer, instead reading: \"The benevolence of her heart, the sweetness of her temper and the extraordinary endowments of her mind obtained the regard of all who knew her and the warmest love of her intimate connections.\"A brass tablet recognizing her literary talents was added in 1872, and her final resting place was celebrated in a poem by Rudyard Kipling: \"Jane lies in Winchester, blessed be her shade! Praise the Lord for making her, and her for all she made.\""}}, {"start_date": {"year": "2013", "month": "1", "day": "21"}, "text": {"headline": "europe", "text": "Read Fast Facts from CNN about British actor Christopher Lee.", "full_article_text": "Here's a look at British actor Christopher Lee.Personal:Birth date: May 27, 1922Death date: June 7, 2015Birthplace: London, EnglandBirth name: Christopher Frank Carandini Lee  Read MoreFather: Geoffrey Lee, a professional soldierMother: Contessa Estelle Marie Carandini di Sarzano Marriage: Birgit \"Gitte\" Kroencke Lee (March 17, 1961 - June 7, 2015, his death)Children: Christina Ericka, November 23, 1963Military Service: Royal Air Force and Special Forces, 1941-1946, Flight LieutenantOther Facts:Speaks four languages: French, Italian, Spanish, and German.Worked with British Intelligence in World War II.Only member of the cast of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy who met author J.R.R.

Yet, a war is very real. It is not only about the destruction of residential areas and fighting militia. It is also about families that argue about what happens, about friends who don't talk to each other anymore and relationships that fall apart.

Silver -- the Grand Prix award -- went to Laszlo Nemes' \"Son of Saul.\" And the award considered the third prize of the film festival, the Prix Du Jury, was won by Yorgos Lanthimos for \"The Lobster.\"These were the top award winners, though they don't tell the whole story of the festival. What are this year's success stories and who is left longing for a better ending? Here's a run through of the frontrunners and the fiascoes: Read MoreThe winners:'Carol'Todd Haynes' movie about two American women in love during the 1950s was a huge hit with critics and set the benchmark for the festival early in the program. Regardless of its success at Cannes, critics here have been talking breathlessly about a raft of Academy Awards come Oscar time next year. Cate BlanchettFast becoming the next Meryl Streep, Australian actress Cate Blanchett is enjoying a purple patch in her career. Many here expect her to follow her Oscar-winning role in \"Blue Jasmine\" with another win for her performance in \"Carol.\" Beyond the movie, her appearance at the film's press conference in Cannes revealed an assured, eloquent woman fielding questions about her personal and professional life with wisdom and humor.JUST WATCHEDCannes: Is Golden Palm the greatest award in film?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCannes: Is Golden Palm the greatest award in film? 02:42'Mad Max' and 'Inside Out'Two of the best-received movies during the Cannes fortnight weren't even in the competition. \"Mad Max\" showed \"Marvel Avengers\" that you don't need CGI (computer-generated imagery) and green screen to create a thrilling, jaw-dropping action film. And Pixar's Pete Docter -- whose Oscar-winning animated epic \"Up\" opened the 2009 Cannes festival -- returned to even greater acclaim with \"Inside Out,\" a charming and hilarious depiction of a testing chapter in a young girl's life seen through the emotions inside her mind.

But it lost out to \"Rams\" by Icelandic director Grimur Hakonarson, who took the top prize in the \"Un Certain Regard\" section with a tale of two elderly brothers whose 40-year dispute is reluctantly put on hold by a threat to their sheep farms.The losers:'Boo boys'Gus Van Sant has long been a Cannes favorite, winning the Palme d'Or in 2003 with his film \"Elephant.\" But Cannes can make and break reputations and his latest film, \"Sea of Trees,\" was roundly panned by critics here -- booed at the press screening and barracked in the reviews that followed. The film features Matthew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe pontificating about life in a forest where people go to die. One particularly barbed commentator suggested the film was the worst ever to feature in the main competition. The Cannes audience is notoriously vocal -- equally capable of delivering a 15-minute standing ovation or walking out after the first 15 minutes of a film. They applaud the festival logo which appears before each screening. And during the opening credits of \"Inside Out\" they booed Disney and cheered Pixar. One particularly offended critic stormed out of a screening shouting \"F**k you and your slow movie!\" JUST WATCHED'Mad Max' thrills critics at Cannes Film FestivalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Mad Max' thrills critics at Cannes Film Festival 02:51The naysayers wield a disproportionate amount of influence as a handful of people booing among a largely appreciative audience leads critics to write the damning words \"mixed reception.\" The opposing crowd are called \"boo boys\" -- but why \"boys?\" Well, the voices of derision in the dark have always seemed to be male. 'Heelgate'The media camped at Cannes had a field day with this scandal. The story was broken by Screen Daily, which reported that a number of women had been turned away from the movie \"Carol\" for wearing flat shoes instead of high heels. Documentary director Asif Kapadia (whose film \"Amy\" about the late singer Amy Winehouse was a big hit at the festival) revealed his wife had also been challenged about her footwear, but was eventually admitted. The story spread like wildfire on traditional and social media, with many citing the festival's dress policy and low number of female directors in competition as evidence of sexism. \"Not so,\" responded festival director Thierry Fremaux, who explained that women were expected to don evening dress and the policing of heel height lay at the feet of one overzealous security official. And if the media wanted signs of sexism, he suggested they begin by looking at the Oscars. Emily Blunt told a press conference she would prefer to walk the carpet in Converse sneakers -- but at the premiere of her film \"Sicario\" a few hours later, she wowed the paparazzi in a long shiny dress offset by a pair of high, shiny heels.No selfie-sticksA growing number of festivals, museums and visitor attractions are banning the selfie-stick, and Cannes entered the debate from the outset when Fremaux announced a campaign to discourage selfies on the red carpet, describing the practice as \"grotesque.\"But his words fell on deaf ears as the stars ignored the advice and couldn't resist the temptation to document their moment on the famous Cannes catwalk. On one night alone, there were more than 100 offenders.Not to be While many critics lavished praise on Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard for their performances in \"Macbeth,\" the titular Scottish titan mumbled the Bard's lines so much that English speakers complained they were forced to read the French subtitles to understand what he was saying. And Shakespeare took a hit in the opening credits, relegated to fourth place behind the film's three screenwriters.Shhhh!For anyone who's had a film ruined by constant chatter emanating from somewhere nearby in the darkness, the \"shushers\" can be regarded as heroes. If you wander about during movies, check your mobile phone and have a good old natter about what's happening on-screen, Cannes is not for you. Any murmur is quickly cut short by a determined \"Shhhhhh!\" One unfortunate soul had the temerity to sneeze during one slow-paced film and was met by an immediate wall of shushing.

The results will be seen as a verdict on how far the industry -- and the country -- has come in the #MeToo era.In the same week that disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and a criminal sexual act, Polanski's film leads the nominations at France's equivalent of the Oscars.It tells the story of a French army captain, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, who was falsely accused -- and convicted of -- treason in 1894. It is considered one of the most infamous wrongful convictions in French history and Dreyfus was eventually exonerated.But Polanski's past means the film's 12 nominations, which include Best Director and Best Film, have proven deeply controversial. The 86-year-old Franco-Polish director pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl in the US in 1977 but fled before sentencing. He has been a fugitive from justice ever since.Roman Polanski disputes rape allegation from French former actress  Read MoreThe film's release is what prompted Valentine Monnier, a French photographer and former actress to speak out last year.In an open letter published by French newspaper Le Parisien last November, Monnier said the Oscar-winning director violently raped her when she was 18.Now 62, Monnier said the alleged rape and assault happened at Polanski's chalet in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad in 1975.\"I thought I was going to die,\" Monnier wrote in Le Parisien.Polanski disputed all of Monnier's allegations, \"in the strongest terms,\" according to his lawyer, Herv\u00e9 Temime.\"I want to remind everyone that these allegations relate to events that are 45 years old,\" Temime said. \"I deplore the publishing of these accusations in Le Parisien on the eve of the film's release.\"Temime threatened legal action against Le Parisien at the time but did not follow through.In 2017, a German actress filed a complaint alleging she had also been raped by Polanski in Gstaad as a minor in 1972. The Swiss prosecutor in that case said the statute of limitations at the time of the alleged assault was 15 years, and the allegation did not result in any criminal charges. At the time, a lawyer for the director called the allegations an absurd attempt to generate media attention.Polanski turned down CNN's request for an interview, but said in a statement that he couldn't attend the C\u00e9sar awards ceremony because he didn't want to \"face a self-proclaimed court of opinion ready to trample on the principles of the rule of law so that the irrational can once again triumph unchallenged.\"\"We already know how the evening will unfold. Activists threatening me with a public lynching,\" he said, in a reference to feminist activists who have vowed to protest outside the venue.Polanski went on to thank the 200 \"remarkable talents\" who worked with him on the film and say part of what kept him from attending was the need to protect his family.The movie has done well at the box office, despite the controversy, with more than 1.6 million tickets sold, according to the latest figures from the French National Cinema Center. Weinstein conviction shows #MeToo made its mark on justice systemOn the day of the announcement of the film's 12 nominations in late January, the then President of the C\u00e9sar Awards Alain Terzian said the Academy was \"not a body that should take moral positions.\"The foreign journalists who hand out prizes for the best French films at the Lumi\u00e8res - the country's equivalent of the Golden Globes -- gave Polanski Best Director in January for \"An Officer and a Spy.\" The group's president, Lisa Nesselson, told CNN: \"It would have been abhorrent if [the movie] had not been nominated in multiple categories, because every frame of this film exudes excellence.\" She added that C\u00e9sar members shouldn't decline to vote for the film because of \"something that's been common knowledge for 43 years\" -- a reference to the 1977 case. \"When people say he's being celebrated, he's being celebrated for something he did that is completely positive,\" Nesselson said. \"He is not being celebrated for something abominable that he did.\"But the case divides opinion -- the fallout from Polanski's C\u00e9sar nominations was one of the reasons its entire board resigned in an attempt to \"regain calm\" in mid-February, just a fortnight before the Paris ceremony. The board's resignation was also prompted by an open letter published in newspaper Le Monde, signed by 400 filmmakers and actors, which called the Academy's leadership dysfunctional and \"a vestige of an era that we would like to be over, that of an elitist and closed system.\"\"We can distinguish a man from his works, from his art, of course,\" French novelist and former Minister of Culture and Communications Aur\u00e9lie Filippetti told CNN, but \"even artists have to, must, respect laws.\"\"[Polanski] has a right to make movies of course, but giving an award is something different. It's a kind of honor you give to a person, not only the movie-maker, but also the person.\"\"France puts art on a pedestal and that's a good thing. But ... they put art on a pedestal when it's about men, not when it's about women.\"\"When you talk about women artists people always talk about their lives ... It's only for men that life is separate from art.\"Roman Polanski's victim asks judge to drop casePolanski is the most-decorated director in the history of the C\u00e9sars, with four awards. In 2017, he was asked to host the ceremony but stepped down because of the backlash. Delphyne Besse, co-chair and co-president of Collectif 50/50, a group that seeks gender parity in the film industry, said she was \"not surprised\" by Polanski's C\u00e9sar nominations given that he won the Grand Jury Prize at last year's Venice film festival and the fact that only one woman has ever won Best Director in the C\u00e9sar's history.  \"He got awarded in every major film festival in the world,\" she said, \"everybody just protected him as long as they could.\" Polanski won an Oscar for The Pianist in 2003, but the group that presides over those awards voted to expel the director from its membership in 2018, saying members had to uphold \"the Academy's values of respect for human dignity.\"Besse added: \"I heard a lot of people saying... imagine all the great movies which wouldn't have been made if he had gone to jail. But I also think of all those films and directors who didn't get to make their own films because they were not supported by the industry the way he was, and I think there is a whole cemetery of unmade films that are worth watching.\"Ad\u00e8le Haenel, the actress who last year accused director Christophe Ruggia of abusing her as a 12-year-old -- which he denies, said at a recent film festival that Polanski's movie should be accompanied by a debate around French rape culture, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, adding \"it would be good for everyone\" to question \"artistic freedom.\"Ruggia, 54, has strongly denied the allegations, with his lawyer saying that he \"is a man who has been destroyed because of one article.\"\"This is a complex issue and one that we all need to discuss,\" Haenel said. \"We can't settle for 'this is creative freedom.' We are in a world where we are all more or less informed about what rape culture means.\"Haenel is nominated for the Best Actress award at Friday's C\u00e9sar for her role in \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire.\" Her talent agency confirmed to CNN she would be attending.The C\u00e9sar Academy's 4,313 members, who decide the award-winners, will provide perhaps the best measure of the French film establishment.
